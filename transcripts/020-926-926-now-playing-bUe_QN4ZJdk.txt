0:04 hi everybody my name is moeri I'm from
0:08 the AI research lab at Nokia B laav it's
0:11 a pleasure to be here today and to
0:13 present to you our cutting age research
0:16 where we apply AI to the challenges of
0:18 the
0:20 future at Nokia we create technologies
0:23 that are improving people's life and
0:26 driving
0:27 sustainability Nokia B lab is Nokia's
0:31 Global Research arm where we are
0:33 focusing on the future of technology
0:36 that
0:37 includes research in network
0:40 fundamentals like 6G next generation of
0:43 Automation and of course AI we see AI as
0:48 being at the center of all the
0:50 technology challenges shaping the
0:54 future so what kind of research we are
0:58 doing around AI
1:00 we have three main area of focus first
1:04 AI fundamentals where we are developing
1:08 Next Generation algorithms language
1:10 models and computer models second AI in
1:15 communication networks we are applying
1:18 AI to wireless and other kind of
1:21 networks across the life cycle of the
1:24 network from design to maintenance and
1:28 customer care and third AI for
1:31 Industrial Automation where we are
1:34 focusing on AI solutions that are
1:38 fueling industry 5.0 by optimizing
1:42 digital Technologies and digital
1:45 twin today I'll be presenting one of our
1:49 our AI research projects where we are
1:52 using AI to create synchronized digital
1:56 copies of physical words this Dynamic
1:59 digital TW technology can add value to
2:03 many businesses for example let's say
2:06 your business uses warehouses for your
2:09 product or you are a sport fan probably
2:13 you are thinking now what do these two
2:16 things have in common well our Dynamic
2:19 digital twin solution can help you
2:22 reduce your cost operation cost in the
2:25 warehouse or revolutionize the way you
2:28 view your favorite sport a sport game
2:32 and let me explain
2:35 how uh now that industrial metaverse is
2:39 going from an idea to reality tools are
2:42 emerging that are allowing us to
2:45 digitally monitor what is going on in
2:49 public or industrial spaces for example
2:52 consider a warehouse when where
2:55 inventory is changing constantly and you
2:58 want to have real time time control and
3:02 monitoring of the warehouse and you want
3:04 to be able to do it remotely well how
3:08 can you do it our solution is based on a
3:11 dynamic digital TN that provides a
3:15 comprehensive understanding of ongoing
3:18 changes another example of a changing
3:20 environment is a sport arena let's say
3:24 you want to be able to transition
3:27 smoothly from One camera view to another
3:30 camera view in a in a game in a hockey
3:33 game for example or you want to view the
3:36 game from a specific seat in the stand
3:39 or you even want to view for let's say
3:42 you even want to view the game from
3:44 right on the eyes where it's usually
3:46 hard to get a good view with a camera
3:49 well with our Dynamic digital T all of
3:52 this is
3:54 possible okay now let me tell you a
3:56 little bit more about it and say where
3:59 they are is in all of this so the main
4:03 question we aim to answer is the
4:06 following how can we create a 3D model
4:10 of an entire space where we have access
4:14 to very limited camera
4:17 views we accomplish this by using a a
4:23 collection of revolutionary techniques
4:25 called Radiance fields and NE Radiance
4:30 field specifically is an example of of
4:33 Radiance field technology where the idea
4:37 is you start with a small set of images
4:41 their corresponding camera poses and
4:44 train a neural network to represent your
4:47 scene then using this trained model you
4:51 are able to uh render images from
4:55 arbitrary angles even the views that you
4:58 haven't seen while with your camera
5:00 while you were capturing uh the the
5:03 scene our Dynamic digital t solution
5:08 transforms this Nerf static model to a
5:12 dynamic representation where real time
5:14 updates are possible and you can view
5:17 changes as they are
5:20 happening now let's uh go back to the
5:23 wherehouse example in order to create a
5:27 dynamic model of of in order to first to
5:31 uh collect images that we need to create
5:34 a model from the warehouse we fly a
5:37 drone in a warehouse with a camera on
5:40 board and capture a small set of
5:43 images here you can see a model an a
5:47 static model that we have created from a
5:50 warehouse then how the question is how
5:53 can we
5:55 dynamically update this model uh with
5:59 with with with the incoming inventory
6:02 well we can fly a drone in the warehouse
6:05 every
6:06 night and capture new inventory as you
6:11 saw in the video here is a first person
6:13 view of what the Drone sees
6:18 actually so to put everything together
6:21 we start by creating a model from empty
6:24 shelves in the
6:26 warehouse then we create photorealistic
6:29 3D models of everything the Drone sees
6:32 and captures and render them in the Nerf
6:36 model our solution also allows for
6:39 overlay of the products information uh
6:43 in the
6:44 model can you imagine
6:47 your can you imagine the experience of
6:50 having access to this upto-date
6:53 augmented uh digital copy of your
6:56 facility that allows you to control and
6:58 monitor the the warehouse from right on
7:01 a tablet rather than going and doing a
7:05 physical spending the time to do a
7:07 physical check this can help you reduce
7:11 the cost of your operation improve the
7:14 accuracy of inventory management and uh
7:17 minimize risk while increasing
7:22 safety now let's talk about the the 3D
7:26 models of a sports arena usually in a
7:28 sports arena in our
7:30 studium cameras are installed in fixed
7:34 position that really restricts the
7:36 angles from which viewers can Spectators
7:39 can view the game as I mentioned before
7:42 our solution is built on Nerf but a
7:45 standard Nerf can
7:48 only represent a static scene so for
7:51 example here you see uh a Nerf that we
7:55 have created from a hockey arena that um
7:59 uh Nokia owns in Finland so how can
8:03 we dynamically update the hockey actions
8:08 in this model we can do so by taking the
8:12 Feats from different camera views
8:15 segment out the players and then render
8:18 them in the Nerf here you see the Fe
8:22 from different camera Fs in the in the
8:24 hockey
8:25 arena here you see the segmentation of
8:28 the player
8:34 and finally this is the rendering in the
8:36 Nerf this is a view from a arbitary seat
8:40 in the
8:42 stand here we can fly from One camera
8:45 view to another
8:49 one and here is the view from right on
8:52 the
8:54 ice so you can imagine like your your
8:58 new and exciting experience once this
9:00 technology is
9:03 deployed so I hope that you like this
9:06 presentation about our uh Dynamic
9:08 digital T technology I'd like to invite
9:11 you to come and visit us at boot 116 you
