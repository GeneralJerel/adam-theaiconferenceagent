0:00 I'm Leslie Jones Dove. I'm the CTO and
0:01 co-founder of Justice Text. Feels pretty
0:04 good. Uh validating um I know we have a
0:07 strong company, strong product. Um and
0:09 I'm happy to see that the people and the
0:11 judges also agree. Justice X is a video
0:14 evidence management platform.
0:16 Essentially, primarily public defenders
0:18 come to our platform. They'll upload
0:20 body cam, jail calls, interrogation
0:21 videos. We'll transcribe it and use AI
0:24 to pull out the incidents that they're
0:26 looking for automatically. We save them
0:28 a whole bunch of time. um in their
0:30 evidence review process. We'll kind of
0:32 continue what we've been doing which is
0:34 essentially growing uh we doubled our
0:36 revenue this year uh and continue to
0:39 embrace and invest in the new
0:41 technologies. So we existed before sort
0:44 of uh chat GBT was released large
0:46 language models got super popular uh but
0:49 when it did get released we wanted to
0:51 make sure that we integrated it in a
0:53 fast and safe way. So we did that and
0:56 our users are already seeing value from
0:57 it. Uh but you know, we've only taken
0:59 the first step. Uh there's a lot more
1:01 things for us to do, a lot more insights
1:03 for us to pull out. Um another thing
1:04 that we're really excited about is our
1:06 sort of vision feature set. Um so
1:08 identifying faces, objects, all of these
1:10 things are super important for any
1:12 attorney looking to review hours and
1:14 hours of video uh and audio evidence.
1:17 Our primary use are public defenders and
1:19 so their feedback tends to be that, you
1:21 know, first and foremost, they're saving
1:24 a whole bunch of time. So this They are
1:28 automated transcripts and the audio that
1:30 we get is not super good. Uh but it's a
1:34 place for them to start. Um it's so much
1:36 easier to go through an actual
1:37 transcript than it is to go through just
1:38 raw video and audio data. Um and before
1:41 public uh Justice X they had nothing.
1:43 And so now they get a fast transcript, a
1:46 very easy to use interface to sort of
1:47 review that evidence and a whole host of
1:49 different tools that they can use to
1:52 prepare for their trial, their cases, um
1:54 and make their lives a lot easier. We
1:56 actually got one attorney who said
1:58 justice sex meant more time with their
2:00 family because they were saving that
2:01 much time. Um, and that's really part of
2:04 the reason why we do this work. We're
2:06 still super excited about large language
2:07 models. We've already integrated a few
2:09 of them into our app. Um, so that users
2:12 can kind of take hundreds, sometimes
2:14 thousands of files and distill it down
2:16 to the key insights that they need to
2:18 sort of prepare for their um their
2:20 cases. Uh, but yeah, people want to know
2:23 who's in their videos. They want to
2:24 start tying the same officer, for
2:26 example, to multiple different videos,
2:28 multiple different cases. Uh same thing
2:30 with objects. Uh perhaps a certain car
2:34 is super important in a set of body cam
2:36 files. Perhaps a gun and when that gun
2:38 appears, if it appears, needs to be
2:40 known. We want to continue saving users
2:43 time answering these key questions that
2:45 they need. I would just say
2:48 get up there, tell a story, tell a
2:50 compelling story. Um, and you know, be
2:53 confident in yourself. I think you're
2:55 here for a reason. They chose you for a
2:56 reason. You have a great company. Um,
2:59 and I think it really is important that
3:01 you sort of craft the story around that
3:03 so it's compelling for the audience, the
3:05 judges, and I guess potential investors
3:08 and even users. I had zero expectations.
3:10 I mean, I knew there would be exposure
3:12 at the very least. Um, so I was happy,
3:14 very much happy for that. And I was
3:16 happy to be here for uh the networking,
3:18 the programming. I mean there's still so
3:21 much for us to do when it comes to uh
3:23 artificial intelligence in our platform
3:25 and so there's so much for me to learn
3:26 as a CTO. So I was mainly mainly looking
3:29 forward to that. This is definitely uh a
3:33 fantastic bonus to this uh experience.
3:36 So very happy about that. Uh thank you
3:38 so much for the opportunity. Um really
