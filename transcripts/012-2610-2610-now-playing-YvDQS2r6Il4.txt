0:08 great welcome everyone I'm excited to be
0:10 moderating this panel um quick
0:13 introduction about myself my name is Ken
0:16 um I'm the author of generational which
0:18 is a substack publication about what
0:20 matters in the business and technology F
0:21 AI if you're interested check it out
0:23 generation. PB um but since this is a VC
0:26 panel um putting on investor hat I'm
0:28 also a venture partner at the fun called
0:30 firsthand Ventures invest in preed uh
0:33 and Seed stage B2B software companies
0:36 but enough about me I'm very fortunate
0:38 to be joined by three amazing investors
0:41 I'll do a brief intro first Alex Alex is
0:44 a partner at light speed Ventures he and
0:46 his uh fund have invested in companies
0:49 like glean as well as um in intense ey
0:53 which uses computer vision to help
0:55 employees um with their health and
0:57 safety and then next we have KU
1:00 partner at coasta ventures she and her
1:02 fund have invested in po aai which is an
1:05 Enterprise voice agent and also open AI
1:07 which everyone knows about and then
1:09 lastly we have Shan partner at ivp um he
1:13 and this fund have invested in the I
1:16 guess the more popular or the most
1:17 popular search companies right now glean
1:19 and perplexity but my introduction does
1:23 not do justice to their experience so
1:25 I'd like to open up this panel with an
1:27 introduction by the panelist themselves
1:30 maybe Alex you can start then we can go
1:31 conu and Tron great sounds good hey
1:34 everyone great to be here I joined light
1:36 speed last year one of the partners on
1:38 the team uh you know as a firm we've
1:40 been investing in the Enterprise space
1:41 for about 30 years um you know the firm
1:43 got started back in 99 so it's been a
1:45 really fun few years just giv all the
1:47 developments in AI I think the level of
1:49 excitement and optimism at the firm uh
1:52 there's just a lot of Buzz um you know
1:54 as a firm obviously we've been long
1:55 investors in AI but in particular the
1:57 last few years have been really exciting
1:59 I focus particular on the application
2:00 layer i' been at Salesforce uh for eight
2:03 years before joining uh the firm uh and
2:06 so really excited about the Innovation
2:07 that we're seeing uh were real business
2:09 use cases um and some of the sort of
2:12 hard problems to be solved for cios it
2:15 decision makers at the app player um and
2:17 so happy to chat more about
2:19 that hi everyone I'm kanu gulati very
2:22 excited to be here uh I'm a partner with
2:24 coasta Ventures which is a multi-stage
2:26 fund but our sweet spot is coming in
2:28 early uh in back bold and impactful
2:31 Ventures uh the fund is fairly
2:34 generalist but we like to back companies
2:37 that have an advantage in a technology
2:39 or a business mode that can then be
2:40 parlayed into a business Advantage uh my
2:43 background uh I have a PhD in we focused
2:46 on speeding up software using hardware
2:48 and I soon realized the only thing most
2:50 interesting to speed up on Hardware is
2:51 AI and for the last decade have been
2:54 focused on just that um I focus on
2:56 applications uh including robotics
2:58 applications uh because increasingly
3:00 those are using AI techniques and also
3:03 uh some
3:04 infrastructure hey I'm Shan partner at
3:07 ivp ibp has been around about 44 years
3:09 we're more of a venture growth firm uh
3:11 so slightly later than uh than they will
3:13 invest occasionally um and for me I was
3:16 at snowflake before this and I spend
3:17 most of my time in infrastructure
3:18 software great awesome so let's kick off
3:22 the Q&A portion I think since this is a
3:24 VC panel I want to structure it like how
3:26 VC St always weighing the opportunities
3:29 versus risk so we'll start with the
3:31 opportunity section and then the risk
3:33 section so on the opportunity side um
3:37 typical question that you probably get
3:39 asked a lot what's the most exciting
3:41 thing now um and then what is your quote
3:44 unquote request for startups at this
3:46 point I can kick us off yeah uh yeah so
3:49 I guess on the request for startups I
3:51 mean I think where we get excited today
3:53 is where Founders have a real deep sort
3:55 of domain insight and they're they're
3:57 really solving a business problem not
3:58 just sort of technology you know I think
4:01 in our experience when you have a really
4:03 Innovative technology like we have today
4:05 with AI it's not just about sort of the
4:08 buzzwords and uh trying to think about
4:11 you know how cool the technology is it's
4:12 really trying to translate that into
4:14 business issues um and so you know you
4:16 talked about intense size an example uh
4:18 computer vision has been obviously a
4:20 really exciting technology but what
4:21 they're doing is uh focused on uh
4:25 preventing health and safety accidents
4:26 and so today that industry is really
4:29 used to to pen and paper folks walking
4:31 around Factory floors uh manufacturing
4:33 facilities industrial settings you know
4:35 something like 3 million people die
4:37 globally every year from workplace
4:38 accidents uh and so instead intensi is
4:41 able to come in and plugs into existing
4:43 cameras and provides 247 alerts you know
4:45 their computer vision models are never
4:47 tired they never not pay attention uh
4:50 and there's this always on technology
4:51 that's solving a really hard problem uh
4:54 and so it's that combination you know I
4:56 think of not only is it a real
4:58 technological Edge and advantage in
5:00 terms of what they' been able to bring
5:01 to the market but there's a real
5:02 business case fast Roi you know a big
5:06 Market opportunity that gets unlocked so
5:07 I think that's one thing that um we get
5:09 really excited about right now uh in
5:11 terms of the ask for Founders and then
5:13 on the first part of your question um
5:15 you know you asked what's sort of super
5:16 exciting you know we've been spending a
5:18 lot of time at vertical application
5:19 software uh there's just a real
5:21 opportunity today I think in the market
5:23 to identify whether it's illegal in
5:26 healthcare in retail what are sort of
5:29 the the new business models and how is
5:30 AI going to really fundamentally change
5:33 some of these industries um as an
5:35 example you know we were an investor in
5:36 even up on the legal space uh and what
5:39 that company does is in the injury
5:40 personal injury law domain is able to
5:43 sort of generate uh demand letters for
5:46 uh law firms and really accelerate you
5:48 know how how quickly they can serve
5:49 clients and get to resolution uh and so
5:52 just a fundamental sort of reimagining
5:53 of how that industry Works uh that's
5:55 been powered by
5:58 I yeah you know I I would add on to that
6:01 uh we are excited about uh applications
6:04 across different Industries across
6:06 different functional aspects within the
6:08 Enterprise and rethinking and
6:09 reimagining how the current capability
6:13 and future capability which I think is
6:15 even more important that imagine if your
6:17 models are going to be Beyond uh the
6:20 high school grade level but coming up to
6:22 say a PhD level or the combined brain
6:24 power of an open AI what can be enabled
6:27 what what can be reimagined in terms of
6:29 the Enterprise uh to give you an example
6:32 uh we are investors in a company called
6:33 cognos which is reimagining what RPA can
6:36 look like because it can allow business
6:38 users uh to lock business logic in
6:42 without needing any tech support or any
6:45 developer time and that completely
6:47 changes what an industry could feel like
6:49 so we're very excited about reimagining
6:51 different Industries different vertical
6:52 but that's not all in addition to uh
6:56 llms we are also excited about what's
6:58 beyond llms we don't think we have
7:00 obviously you know we investors in open
7:02 Ai and Sakana and we think they are here
7:05 to stay and they are going to be very
7:06 powerful and and and continue to provide
7:09 a lot of Leverage to a lot of different
7:10 applications but we are also in the camp
7:13 that there will be different kinds of
7:14 intelligences that we should continue to
7:15 fund and we are investing in or looking
7:18 at other neuros symbolic techniques and
7:20 Beyond so very excited about those and
7:22 encouraging Founders to look Beyond even
7:24 llms now we're generalist fund so I'm
7:27 only going to speak for myself here at
7:28 ivp but I I tend to focus mostly on
7:30 infra and for infra it's actually with
7:32 one notable exception we're mostly focus
7:34 on general purpose infra that has an
7:36 even more compelling why now because of
7:38 how the application stack is changing
7:40 that being said there's actually a lot
7:42 of stuff I'm personally very passionate
7:43 about on the creativity and curiosity
7:45 front so if you think about if you're
7:47 curious about a subject the best place
7:48 to go in my opinion is perplexity if
7:50 you're curious about a subject
7:51 internally and try to understand how you
7:53 can better do your job you go to glean
7:55 and creativity there are dozens of tools
7:57 out there we haven't invested in them
7:58 but that are doing amazing job of
8:00 translating what's in your head into
8:01 paper or design or screen so to speak uh
8:04 maybe on more on the personal front I'm
8:05 an 18-month-old and so one of the things
8:06 I'm really passionate about is are there
8:08 going to be a set of products that are
8:10 not screen based that emerge that can
8:12 really drive a curiosity Revolution
8:13 among kids maybe that's a product like
8:16 curio and what they're doing on the on
8:17 the toy front maybe there's going to be
8:18 an AI enabled ET a sketch but that stuff
8:20 that's maybe my my personal request for
8:22 startups awesome okay so we talked about
8:25 what's uh exciting for all of you now
8:28 but I want to do time travel back to
8:30 maybe early 2023 cuz it hasn't even been
8:33 2 years since chat GPT was launched um
8:35 but the space has evolved really really
8:37 fast and I think it's only been a little
8:39 bit uh over a year since gp4 was
8:42 launched so take yourself back then um
8:46 what was exciting to you back then that
8:48 probably at this time isn't as exciting
8:51 how has your thesis changed over that
8:52 time
8:53 period open up to
8:56 anyone I can kick us off in that answer
8:59 so so we've been because um we we were
9:01 fortunate enough to be the earliest
9:03 Venture investor in open AI we've been
9:04 tracking that space very carefully very
9:06 closely uh gpd2 came out in 2019 uh GPD
9:10 3 and Chad GPD really made uh the news
9:14 uh that's when people got really excited
9:15 about the emerging capabilities that
9:17 come from scale and I think there's a
9:19 lot more to be seen about what can be
9:21 done with scale and so we haven't
9:23 stopped there but going back then I
9:26 think we
9:27 were we were just excited about how uh
9:32 uh you know what can the creative
9:34 writing experience be and we were
9:36 looking at a number of applications that
9:37 can be powered including code automation
9:41 it was really really early we were one
9:42 of the earliest investors in a company
9:43 called repet which started with enabling
9:46 the citizen developer to create complete
9:49 applications and the the part that I
9:52 continue to get excited about is
9:53 building companies or building
9:55 applications that can continue to
9:57 leverage and take advantage of
9:59 Improvement in underlying alms so there
10:02 should be an informed opinion on uh and
10:05 we should try to do our best in in
10:07 informing that opinion on what GPD 5 or
10:09 a gpd6 or a gpn could look like and
10:12 build applications or build our
10:13 companies with that in mind so that's
10:15 the ongoing Trend that I continue to be
10:17 excited about which started off with
10:19 gbt2 and gbd3 and it's going to continue
10:21 and creating just more empowered
10:24 applications for us maybe in contrast to
10:26 Cano there's a reason I'm not an early
10:28 stage investor which is I tend to be a
10:29 little late to the game um and so I was
10:31 not aware of gpt2 I was not tracking all
10:33 that sort of stuff that being said I've
10:35 worked in companies where we were trying
10:36 to bring machine learning into the
10:37 Enterprise over the past decade and so I
10:40 was blown away when I first used chat
10:41 GPT but I still think I had a little bit
10:43 of that scar tissue of the difficulties
10:45 and barriers to adoption and so I was
10:47 actually more on the skeptical side very
10:49 incorrectly about how Enterprises how
10:52 quickly Enterprises would be adopting AI
10:53 Technologies how quickly they'd be
10:55 redefining their stack how quickly
10:56 they'd be redefining their Workforce
10:58 that is something I totally
11:00 underestimated um so that's been really
11:03 fascinating to see I actually sh I
11:05 actually think some of that skepticism
11:06 is well founded and I think um what's so
11:09 to answer the first part of your
11:10 question I still remember that first
11:12 time you typed into that chat bot and
11:14 you sort of got that response it felt
11:15 magical uh it reminded me the very first
11:18 time I sort of connected on AOL and you
11:20 know post Diop speed and you sort of
11:22 click on a website and it took 45
11:24 seconds to see a little Banner that felt
11:26 magical you know the first time you had
11:27 an email uh on this thing called a
11:29 mobile device that you sort of had in
11:31 your pocket and you're like oh my God I
11:32 can't believe I could sort of do this on
11:34 here there was a a real moment of magic
11:37 and I I felt similar when you know the
11:39 first time uh you know using one of
11:41 these tools and I think I thing that's
11:42 amazed me the most is just the Zeitgeist
11:44 how quickly you know you look at the
11:45 speed of which you know we back
11:46 companies like anthropic and Mistral and
11:49 how fast customers are adopting it
11:51 having said that I think your instinct
11:52 of like security privacy uh data
11:55 governance like those are hard
11:57 challenges and I think we've we've
11:58 crossed that point now where we're
12:00 outside of sort of the uh wave of
12:02 optimism and now the rubber really needs
12:04 to hit the meet the road and I think it
12:06 decision makers are really figuring out
12:08 how to actually deploy these systems in
12:10 production because they're cool and fun
12:12 but we also need to drive business value
12:13 and we also have to do it in a secure
12:14 and Safe Way and so as a firm you know
12:17 having invested as sort of the
12:18 infrastructure layer we're also
12:20 investing a lot at the tooling layer you
12:21 know giving companies uh whether it's
12:23 companies like ponis uh on the sort of
12:26 uh governance side or EXA on the sort of
12:28 search side really helping create the
12:30 tooling infrastructure to build that
12:32 trust because I think that's that's
12:33 needed now yeah and I want to piggy back
12:36 off of that um on tooling um this is a
12:40 question for shvan but Kan and Alex as
12:42 well right so shvan you've worked at
12:45 some of the most um iconic
12:46 infrastructure companies snowflake um as
12:49 well as confluent you've also invested
12:51 in some of the a companies that have
12:53 seen the scale and adoption that Alex
12:56 was mentioning Gan and perplexity what's
12:58 breaking at the structure layer what's
13:00 new there um and kuu and Alex what have
13:04 you seen what with uh companies you're
13:06 involved with as well I think it's hard
13:07 to say things are breaking because so
13:09 much is new I think things are just
13:11 being discovered in terms of how to
13:12 actually build an application that
13:14 scales in a very different way than
13:16 prior Applications had to scale whether
13:17 it's a Reliance on external models and
13:19 infrastructure versus internal whether
13:21 it's how you have to orchestrate a
13:22 different models together to get to get
13:24 the best performance things like that I
13:25 think there are some very known problems
13:28 uh you heard probably early from any
13:29 scale also about scaling and how do you
13:31 reliably serve models in production
13:33 we're investors in a company called Bas
13:34 10 which does that remarkably well as
13:36 well um so it's hard to say that
13:38 anything's breaking because I think the
13:40 reality is just not much is actually in
13:42 production at scale in large Enterprises
13:45 so there are lots of techniques people
13:46 are going for whether it's Rags LMS as
13:48 judges evals uh guard rails things like
13:51 that to try and get ahead of some of
13:52 these problems but I think there's still
13:54 a lot of the phase of we don't know what
13:55 we don't know um and I think that'll
13:58 start to change probably over the next
13:59 year or two as people start to get
14:00 things in production realize what breaks
14:03 and then figure out a lot of
14:04 infrastructure around it that's I think
14:05 why we've also been a little bit more
14:06 patient on our AI infrastructure
14:08 investing is we wanted to wait for
14:10 applications to reach scale for those
14:12 problems to become a little bit more
14:13 known before we then started making some
14:15 more
14:18 bets yeah for us the um ml Ops or llm
14:22 Ops category has been a harder one to
14:25 invest in because it's it's hard to see
14:28 how does a you know a company at the
14:30 scale of a public company like a neural
14:31 like or a data dog can exist for just
14:34 doing say one very small portion of llm
14:38 like say just observability or just uh
14:42 you know evals is hard and and similarly
14:44 you mention some other areas like rag I
14:46 think there are two challenges one you
14:48 don't want to invest in anything which
14:49 is very very adjacent to what the model
14:52 providers or the model Hub uh has can
14:55 build because they just have immense
14:56 mind share they have the right
14:57 capability they're seeing what sorts of
14:59 use cases the developer Community wants
15:01 to build how they want to use it and
15:03 they have an advantage there so as a
15:04 startup you don't want to build
15:06 something that's in the you know
15:08 roadkill of one of the large model
15:10 providers and at the same time um you
15:13 have to go after a large enough
15:14 interesting market and sometimes if
15:16 you're only focus on a very tiny
15:18 vertical because it's niche you can win
15:20 that market but then where and so we've
15:23 we've been looking we continue to look
15:24 you know we we've done model providers
15:26 more easily but in order to look at llm
15:29 Ops uh we we we're continuing on the
15:31 hunt so very excited to meet Founders to
15:33 help us refine our Theses here totally
15:36 agree yeah I think one of the things
15:38 that uh interesting I picked up on is
15:41 like you're waiting for applications to
15:42 scale see where things break and then
15:44 look at what infrastructure is required
15:47 so Alex you've written about SAS 4.0 um
15:51 and you mentioned this is a fourth
15:52 generation of software applications
15:54 called the system of cognition I guess
15:56 maybe for the crowd for the audience can
15:58 you elaborate more on that and then the
16:00 thing I'm curious about that attaching a
16:02 second question to is is like there's a
16:04 growing refrain rightly or wrongly that
16:07 AI is a feature not the product or
16:10 capability or a company curious how you
16:12 kind of mesh those Frameworks and that
16:14 refrain yeah for sure so if the sort of
16:17 a cognition quite simply is uh really
16:19 software going end to end so if you look
16:21 at you know I mentioned I was at
16:22 Salesforce before back in 99 Salesforce
16:24 really pioneered the shift of the cloud
16:26 maybe we call that sort of SAS 1.0 when
16:28 use had on- premise applications that
16:30 then became cloudbased you can access
16:31 them to a browser 2.0 was a sort of
16:34 explosion the number of SAS applications
16:36 from sort of the 2005 2015 era if you
16:39 will and more and more of these systems
16:41 started talking to each other you know
16:42 companies like moft and slack really
16:44 embody that shift and then 3.0 was sort
16:47 of this early sign of intelligence where
16:49 um you know companies like gong and
16:50 moveworks really started doing next best
16:53 action and it sort of felt like the the
16:55 tool had some insight and visibility
16:56 that was helping uh the human do their
16:58 job
16:59 I think what we're about to go into is
17:01 this sort of really the ability for
17:02 software going to end I actually whoever
17:04 thinks it's a feature I I really would
17:06 disagree with I think this is one of the
17:07 most fundamental uh Transformations
17:10 we're going to see and I think what's
17:11 interesting you know when you talk to
17:12 customers who are buying these tools
17:14 they really think about it about not
17:16 just sort of it spend uh but about sort
17:18 of actual labor spend you know and I
17:20 think the size the opportunity um you
17:22 know a great example is uh we we've made
17:25 an investment in a company that helps
17:26 automate manual data entry um and for
17:29 most people that's a very repetitive
17:30 timec consuming laborious job they would
17:33 much rather be focused on meeting with a
17:35 customer you know another canonical
17:37 example of this is a company called the
17:39 bridge doctors spend two hours a day
17:41 typing up notes at the end of the day
17:43 it's one of the biggest reasons for
17:45 Burnout in the medical profession is
17:46 just how long it takes them to type
17:47 these notes up uh and so wouldn't it be
17:50 amazing if they just had this sort of
17:52 device with them that recorded
17:53 transcribed everything Auto sort of
17:55 summarized the note for the patient
17:57 created all the next steps and the
17:59 doctor can do what they do best which is
18:01 really you know sit in front of the the
18:03 patient figure out what's going on and
18:04 how to help them be healthier as opposed
18:06 to sitting there thinking about notes
18:08 and the administrative part of their job
18:10 and so that's where we get really
18:11 excited about this sort of recognition
18:13 is what are those tasks uh that today
18:16 have just been unencumbered and these
18:17 reasoning engines are at the point now
18:19 where they can actually decide and do
18:21 next steps and uh drive that automation
18:24 end to end and so I think it's I've been
18:26 investing in technology for about 15
18:28 years
18:29 I have never been more excited about
18:30 sort of the opportunity set just because
18:32 it feels that we're the cusp of this s
18:34 Revolution yeah and there yeah one
18:38 another way to look at the space I would
18:40 say or we talk about it internally is is
18:43 a co-pilot and an autopilot and there is
18:45 multiple um you know applications where
18:48 both could could be really large
18:49 opportunities for example a GitHub
18:51 co-pilot which helps make an engineer
18:53 10x their performance or productivity uh
18:56 that helps an uh
18:59 a a professional with just improving
19:01 their output on the other hand there is
19:03 an autopilot mode where you can get the
19:06 tasks done end to end under still some
19:08 human supervision but for example uh I'm
19:11 an investor in a company called Reggie
19:12 which is automates the sales SDR uh
19:15 activities uh everything from the
19:17 initial reach out on a cold email
19:20 figuring out how to personalize figuring
19:21 out look look alike accounts all the way
19:24 to uh you know the surround sound from
19:26 LinkedIn messaging to uh every all of
19:28 these actions are now being taken by AI
19:30 n to end and there are multiple examples
19:33 uh I think it becomes very important to
19:35 understand where the advantage comes in
19:37 where does the data flywheel come in and
19:38 what allows for a bigger larger
19:40 opportunity in that particular vertical
19:42 for that particular Market but there is
19:44 room for both co-pilots and autopilots
19:46 that's another way to think about the
19:47 opportunity here got it and we have a
19:50 couple minutes left but I think you
19:52 mentioned data fly will and that's often
19:54 a term um a lot of investors use to as a
19:58 way to kind of fix figure out whether to
20:00 how to evaluate the startup so want to
20:02 jump into the risk portion given the
20:04 couple minutes we have left is like is
20:07 there any difference between how you
20:09 evaluate in diligence a AI startup
20:12 versus a non- a startup curious how you
20:14 even Define ai versus non- aai in this
20:17 in this front um maybe I'll start with
20:20 that yeah I can share some quick
20:22 thoughts on that I mean I think the the
20:23 sort of hardest thing right now when
20:25 we're meeting new companies and making
20:26 investment decisions is really just a
20:28 pace change you know you talked about
20:30 how it's only been a couple years I mean
20:31 it's kind of incredible what we've seen
20:33 in the market since then um and so we
20:35 think a lot about durability about you
20:37 know the company's ability to sort of
20:39 drive and it's not just incumbents uh
20:41 that have an advantage because of the
20:43 sort of existing go to market reach and
20:44 their existing customer relationships
20:46 it's also just the number of new
20:47 entrance that are coming around and so
20:49 we are looking for what are the Moes uh
20:51 you know historically in software
20:53 execution was often times one of the
20:54 best modes and then you drive workflow
20:56 to drive stickiness um I think we're at
20:59 a point now where we need to look beyond
21:00 that and we're looking for places the
21:02 reason vertical SAS I think is so
21:03 interesting is typically like a
21:05 horizontal player like the Salesforce
21:07 will not think about that vertical as a
21:09 sort of corol part of their business you
21:11 know they're they're very focused on
21:12 serving all customers uh and so if you
21:14 can start with an initial wedge uh that
21:17 is really interesting and might not be
21:18 sort of noticed by one of the bigger
21:20 incumbents that have it go to market
21:22 advantage over you you can sort of Drive
21:24 uh durability and then get to the point
21:26 where you have your own sort of data
21:27 flywheel or technology flywheel and you
21:30 earn the right to grab that next uh sort
21:32 of Milestone so I I I think what's been
21:34 amazing about this era is you know you
21:36 look at Salesforce Microsoft Adobe
21:38 service now just how fast they've
21:40 innovated I think you know in the prior
21:43 when it was Cloud on premise to cloud
21:44 and then the Mobile Shift a lot of those
21:46 those new companies um and actually I
21:48 think the incumbents have done a
21:49 remarkable job and so uh you know really
21:52 think about what are those vectors of
21:54 differentiation and you can't just build
21:56 uh you know as much as we love uh sort
21:58 of our investments in anthropic and mral
22:01 you can't just build and just ride those
22:03 Tailwinds right you have to sort of
22:04 think about what is your own IP that
22:06 you're going to develop I probably add
22:08 just one thing to that which is that the
22:11 it is easier than ever to start a
22:12 company it's harder than ever to scale a
22:13 company because of that competition and
22:15 so the the level of creativity you have
22:18 to have from a business model standpoint
22:20 and from a go to market standpoint how
22:22 you acquire users how you resonate with
22:24 people is just it's so much harder than
22:26 ever before so
22:28 I'm a VC I I don't know what people
22:30 should do uh but I think there's a lot
22:32 of really exciting things like I think
22:34 I'm going to come back to perplexity you
22:35 see some of the creativity they have
22:36 with their ads how they're partnering
22:38 with Telos to get distribution things
22:39 like that those are the types of things
22:41 you have to do in order to really stand
22:43 out right now it's still fully
22:45 conditional about having a magical
22:46 product experience so nothing replaces
22:47 that but I think it's easier than ever
22:49 to build a magical product experience
22:50 which is the
22:52 tradeoff yeah um I agree on the you know
22:56 the incumbents have a distribution
22:57 advantage and that's hard to mimic just
22:59 by using llms but we can I think there's
23:01 a lot of opportunity in reimagining uh
23:04 completely different approaches for
23:06 example we've invested in a company
23:07 called moonhub which is building a
23:09 recruiting agency themselves so they're
23:11 not providing say just recruiting
23:14 software or an ATS for an inside
23:16 recruiter they're changing and becoming
23:18 a recruiting agency themselves and
23:20 behind the scenes a lot of the digital
23:22 tasks are being automated end to endend
23:23 by agents uh and internally their
23:25 margins are getting better as the models
23:27 next set of models keep getting better
23:29 uh but now the the business model is
23:32 completely changed uh and I think I
23:34 think all of you are way more creative
23:36 and we'll come up with new companies
23:37 that we will want to you know fight
23:39 amongst ourselves to invest so I'm not
23:42 concerned that there is no opportunities
23:44 left or you know there is nothing I I
23:46 think people are just very very creative
23:47 and there's a a huge huge huge amount of
23:51 new a wave of companies that's going to
23:53 come and we're in the very early Innings
23:55 of what this AI wave is going to get us
23:57 okay okay yeah um I have a ton of
24:00 questions left unfortunately like it is
24:02 time but I'm going to sneak in one more
24:05 each panelist give a hot take on AI and
24:08 answer should be like 30 seconds or less
24:10 and then with that we'll wrap up the
24:12 panel after
24:15 that Alex you can go first I can start
24:17 yeah sounds good I think so if you look
24:19 at my my hot take is just how quickly
24:21 it's going to take to build trillion
24:22 dollar companies you know if you look at
24:24 today um there's you know Microsoft and
24:27 uh amazing job in apple it's sort of the
24:29 three trillion plus Mark these companies
24:31 have been around for 50 plus years uh
24:34 you know sometimes 30 40 years I think
24:36 we're going to see a trillion dollar
24:37 company in in the next five years uh and
24:39 I just think the pace at which this
24:41 Innovation is coming I couldn't agree
24:42 more that we're just at the very
24:43 beginning uh and it's just such an
24:45 exciting time and so the pace we we all
24:48 are used to technology moving fast I
24:49 think we're in for a wild ride so I
24:51 would say buckle
24:53 up
24:55 I we we we hinted on this before but yes
24:58 you know because of the pace again I
24:59 think the the underlying capability from
25:02 uh the the models themselves is just
25:04 increasing improving at a at just even
25:07 faster rate uh so now we you know from
25:10 from a high school student to this PhD
25:11 level reasoning to maybe the combined
25:14 brain power of of a research lab uh I
25:18 think my my hot take would be just focus
25:19 on building companies that can leverage
25:21 that growth uh and not plan for what's
25:24 out there today but what will be in the
25:25 next 2 years or 5 years
25:29 for me I just I don't think co-pilots
25:31 are generally good strategies that's my
25:32 lukewarm to hot take I think unless
25:34 speaking for Enterprise startups uh I
25:37 think co-pilots are best for incumbents
25:39 or for products that have really shitty
25:40 uxs so instead if you just build like if
25:43 you have a great product a co-pilot
25:45 often times slows you down um and so
25:48 focus on that which I know is a standard
25:50 VC ISM but I believe it yeah awesome we
25:53 are out of time unfortunately but if you
25:55 have questions for the panelists they
25:57 may stick around right after the panel
26:00 um with that thank you Alex conu andon
26:03 thank you Kim thank you
