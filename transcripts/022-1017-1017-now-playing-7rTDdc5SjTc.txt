0:04 hello um I'm ches um co-founder and CTO
0:07 at orb um orb as as I was introduced is
0:11 a usage based billing infrastructure
0:12 company um so we power Cloud billing for
0:16 lots of companies across infrastructure
0:19 um but specifically uh especially some
0:21 of the faster growing ones in AI today's
0:23 talk is not uh primarily about billing
0:26 or even about orb it is about pricing so
0:29 I just want to jump straight into that
0:30 it's a lightning talk we only have so
0:31 much time so let's start um pricing you
0:35 should think of as friction ultimately
0:38 your customers don't want to think about
0:40 pricing they want to use your product um
0:42 but friction can be good friction is how
0:44 you assess customer value it's how you
0:45 understand uh whether you're building
0:47 something that's actually useful to the
0:49 audience that you're targeting so if you
0:50 start thinking about pricing like
0:51 friction you can think of it as you know
0:53 steps in a new user flow where adding
0:55 some friction is good adding too much
0:57 friction leads to drop off and so you
0:58 need to think about how to balance those
1:00 two things there's three key principles
1:02 I want to cover today around pricing the
1:04 first is thinking about your audience uh
1:07 ultimately your pricing is for someone
1:08 just like your product is for someone
1:10 and and ideally those two things match
1:12 your margin structure we are talking to
1:14 a crowd of folks in Ai and and I'm sure
1:16 that costs and margins are very top of
1:18 mind for a lot of people here and then
1:21 uh pricing flexibility I think this is
1:22 one of the things that most companies
1:24 think about uh not enough or or perhaps
1:27 too late and it's something especially
1:28 in a fast moving land landscape like AI
1:30 you need to start thinking about early
1:32 so let's start with the first you really
1:35 need to think about your target audience
1:37 for your product and your pricing U this
1:39 starts by thinking through what is the
1:41 segment that you are attempting to
1:43 capture how are they thinking about the
1:45 buying decision overall uh often times
1:47 AI companies are selling to a
1:49 combination of individual developers uh
1:51 as well as big Enterprises and as many
1:54 of you know big Enterprises have
1:55 procurement teams and buying processes
1:57 and if you try to deploy that same
1:58 pricing and go to market and sales
2:00 motion at an individual developer
2:02 they're going to be like hey just give
2:03 me the product I want to start using it
2:05 and so thinking about how your pricing
2:07 relates to your audience is really
2:09 important um in in almost all cases uh
2:13 having simple and predictable pricing is
2:15 very important there are some companies
2:17 that challenge this and I'll show you a
2:18 few examples but uh you you can only
2:20 challenge this with lots of Market pull
2:22 and with extreme care uh and you should
2:25 think about how your pricing is changing
2:28 the behavior of your target audience
2:30 because your pricing creates incentives
2:32 and it causes your customers not only to
2:34 buy in a specific way but also use your
2:36 product in a specific way and and we'll
2:37 cover some examples of that so maybe to
2:40 start here's an example you all have
2:42 probably seen this page uh it is the
2:45 pricing page for AWS Aurora Aurora is a
2:47 a database offering from AWS and this
2:50 pricing page tells a story uh probably
2:53 many stories one is it is varying the
2:56 weeds so it is clearly targeted people
2:58 who understand the context of Aurora
3:00 it's a it's a pretty complicated pricing
3:02 page um you can see that the pricing
3:05 axes are in terabytes per month that
3:08 tells a story about how Aurora is meant
3:10 to be used at what data scale it's meant
3:12 to be used that's that's very purposeful
3:14 um and perhaps the thing that's
3:16 highlighted with this Arrow data
3:18 transfer in is free to AWS but data
3:21 transfer out is not that tells a story
3:23 of incentives and obviously AWS wants
3:25 you to bring data into to their platform
3:27 and so they're pushing incentives by by
3:30 this pricing model um lots of people who
3:33 think about pricing will see especially
3:35 Engineers will see a page like this and
3:37 be like ah this is shitty right like
3:39 this is not a pricing page this is a
3:41 contact us page I want a pricing page
3:43 but I think it is worth saying that
3:45 contact sales for a custom quote is
3:47 about the audience it's it's just not
3:49 meant for an individual developer
3:51 service now is presumably not selling to
3:53 you if you look at the page and say oh
3:55 my God that sucks um and in reality
3:58 probably in this case uh service now is
4:00 trying to cross sell um their their new
4:03 product to people who are already using
4:05 service now so the value sale and
4:07 understanding what the existing usage
4:09 pattern is for that audience is very
4:11 important and so talking to a
4:13 salesperson is kind of a critical part
4:15 of their goto market and sales process
4:17 let's look at another example this is
4:18 cloud flare um and this is pricing for
4:21 R2 which is their product that um
4:24 competes with or compares to S3 uh this
4:26 is a good example because uh Cloud flare
4:29 has done a bunch of work and we'll see
4:31 it in in a couple examples later on to
4:33 differentiate their product and their
4:34 architecture and their pricing but you
4:36 need to think about where people are
4:37 coming from if someone is used to paying
4:39 for S3 in a specific way whether that's
4:41 API operations or storage and now
4:43 they're trying to size up how would it
4:45 look like to move this workload to R2
4:48 it's important that you make that
4:49 transition as easy as possible and if
4:52 they can't predict how their workload is
4:53 going to compare or how they're going to
4:55 map quantities on S3 to quantities on R2
4:57 they're going to have a much much harder
4:59 time making the buying decision and so
5:02 there's a very different pricing motion
5:03 you have to go through when thinking
5:04 through a lift and shift use case versus
5:06 a net new use case where you know it's a
5:08 new product that maybe people haven't
5:10 thought about the pricing dimensions for
5:12 before let's talk about the second uh
5:15 structure which is margins and costs uh
5:17 many of you have probably heard this
5:18 quote your margin is my opportunity uh
5:21 really getting at this idea that
5:23 ultimately you know you can set pricing
5:25 arbitrarily you can have really great
5:27 margins but especially now when the cost
5:29 of building software is getting lower a
5:31 new company will come in and take that
5:33 opportunity to undercut your margin so
5:35 this is a an area that I think
5:36 increasingly so you have to think
5:38 critically about um I think the big
5:40 takeaway here is think about your cost
5:43 structure given the architecture of your
5:45 product what does it scale with rather
5:47 than thinking about the exact costs uh
5:49 ultimately if open AI or anthropic or a
5:51 different underlying model compute
5:53 provider changes or or halves costs
5:55 overnight which is prone to happen your
5:57 literal cost will change um but your
6:00 cost structure will probably stay the
6:01 same so so a couple things think about
6:03 the axis on which your cost scale and
6:04 how that relates to your pricing and
6:07 think about what architectural
6:08 advantages you have that you can then
6:10 pass on into your pricing ultimately
6:12 that's going to be something that is is
6:15 harder for other people to just track
6:16 one for one so if you think about costs
6:19 there's you know roughly three costs
6:20 there's especially in AI uh there
6:23 there's models there's the training of
6:25 the models and then there's the devops
6:27 around the model um so of course it
6:29 depends on are you're operating but um
6:32 you have to think about all of these
6:33 costs when you're thinking about pricing
6:34 your product because ultimately none of
6:36 them are likely to converge to zero
6:38 they're all going to have some marginal
6:39 cost and um let's look at a few examples
6:43 so in this case this is an example of uh
6:46 cloudflare again and you can see they're
6:48 charging for CPU milliseconds uh I think
6:50 this is their workers product uh
6:52 cloudflare made an early architecture
6:54 decision to build on top of worker
6:56 isolates which are much more lightweight
6:58 ways of running serverless functions
7:00 this lets them charge not for wall time
7:02 but for CPU time specifically and I
7:04 think this is a great Advantage compared
7:06 to other serverless products and again
7:08 it's an example of them taking an early
7:10 architectural bet that panning out and
7:12 then them being able to translate that
7:14 to specific value for the use cases that
7:17 they're trying to power for their
7:18 customers another good example this is
7:21 uh from modal modal has done a bunch of
7:23 work to make uh very specific
7:25 optimizations to their underlying file
7:28 system and they they've done a ton of
7:29 infrastructure lowlevel work and so they
7:31 can charge at a very very granular level
7:34 per second um and this is the sort of
7:36 thing where imagine cold starts were
7:39 really expensive on this platform
7:41 charging per second just wouldn't make
7:43 sense and so Translating that underlying
7:45 architecture to a pricing decision
7:47 sometimes costs aren't the high order
7:49 bit this specific article has been
7:50 debated many times over regardless of
7:53 this example um you know GitHub charges
7:55 for co-pilot on a dollar seat basis does
7:58 that really make sense for margins
7:59 probably not there are probably uh lots
8:02 of customers who use co-pilot a lot and
8:04 there are customers who don't use
8:05 co-pilot at all so their margins are
8:07 probably pretty funky but Simplicity
8:08 matters too and so this is another
8:10 example of slack charging for AI on a
8:13 dollar seat basis because they're really
8:15 trying to just push adoption of Slack's
8:17 AI product let's talk a little bit about
8:20 pricing flexibility um and so most
8:22 companies think uh partially because
8:25 they don't have the infrastructure
8:26 tooling but partially because this is
8:27 how SAS pricing has been they think of
8:30 pricing as a set it and forget it
8:31 exercise but in reality you're spending
8:34 a ton of money on R&D your product is
8:35 changing your value uh delivery is
8:38 increasing and your value capture should
8:40 increase too and uh you know if you all
8:43 engineers in the room think of data
8:44 migrations it's the sort of thing where
8:46 if you start to do it very often it does
8:48 become easier most companies uh they
8:51 have a sudden price change which is bad
8:53 for them it's bad for their customers
8:55 whereas value is changing continually
8:58 and so uh the more you can converge to
9:00 the picture on the right where you're
9:01 capturing that as time goes on the
9:03 better uh so this is an example of pine
9:05 cone uh both rolling out a serverless
9:08 offering but also changing their pricing
9:10 to match which can drive massive Roi a
9:13 pricing model we see a lot that's
9:15 related to this is being able to roll
9:17 something like prepaid credits out um
9:19 and this gives you a ton of axes of you
9:22 know being able to differentiate and add
9:23 levers to your pricing to account for
9:25 fluctuating demand or Enterprise
9:26 contract structures so being able to do
9:28 this is can be really valuable there's a
9:31 couple of technical challenges related
9:33 to implementing pricing well of course
9:34 there's the business logic there's the
9:36 customer experience giving visibility
9:38 there's the auditability and of course
9:39 there's the kind of data infrastructure
9:41 we work with companies that generate
9:43 thousands or even millions of events a
9:45 second that feed into their pricing so
9:47 that's what orb does we we are a billing
9:49 platform built purpose built for these
9:51 use cases we help you both implement the
9:53 pricing as well as evolve it over time
9:56 so that you can change your pricing much
9:57 more flexibly um
9:59 and that's it um thank you for listening
10:02 to the talk we are downstairs at a booth
10:05 I think
10:06 246 um happy to take questions then and
10:09 maybe one question now
