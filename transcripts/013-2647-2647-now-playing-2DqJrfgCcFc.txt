0:06 good morning everyone um welcome to the
0:08 conference and um excited for the
0:10 session today which I think is going to
0:12 be a really really interesting and
0:13 thought-provoking conversation um with
0:16 with Dr Palm I'm going to go by um I
0:18 think before we kind of dive into the
0:20 content of this um let's um let's do
0:22 some intros for everyone I'll I'll kind
0:24 of lead off I'll I'll make mine quick
0:25 and I think everyone would love to hear
0:27 how you end up as as cdao and we'll have
0:30 a kind of great free flowing
0:31 conversation and then hopefully leave a
0:33 little bit of time for some questions if
0:34 there are some um and so um everyone as
0:37 um as Ben mentioned I'm Brian Raymond
0:39 founder and CEO of unstructured um we
0:42 focus on ingestion and pre-processing of
0:45 unstructured data we have an open source
0:46 project and the commercial offering my
0:48 background though um let's call it like
0:50 a nonlinear career path so um started
0:52 out at CIA as as an analyst um at the
0:54 CIA for um a number of years then moved
0:57 down and worked in the Obama
0:58 Administration I was a director on the
1:00 National Security Council and then um
1:03 2018 time frame um back out here to San
1:06 Francisco I'm from Northern California
1:09 worked at a company called primary AI
1:10 for a while where we were doing
1:11 knowledge graft generation and um and
1:13 then founded unstructured a couple years
1:15 ago um but brought it over to you thanks
1:18 um I too had a nonlinear career um I
1:21 started uh I was I have a PhD in
1:23 economics and I sort of started out on a
1:25 traditional academic track was an
1:26 assistant professor and then went um
1:30 went off to Afghanistan to do some
1:32 research um and and ended up through a
1:35 series of events after that going into
1:36 the government and working in in the
1:39 Pentagon and then at the National
1:40 Security Council and Department of
1:41 energy really focused on creating sort
1:44 of Applied analysis informing
1:47 policy-making processes and decisions um
1:49 left government in 2017 2016 and uh went
1:53 out and and worked in Tech so I started
1:55 out in Facebook I was a ux researcher
1:58 and then ran a team of researchers and
2:00 data scientists um went to Google ran a
2:03 slightly bigger team um really focused
2:05 on both on the business process side and
2:07 then on the detection and sort of uh
2:10 platform management side um in Google uh
2:14 and then in 2021 went back into
2:16 government somewhat unexpectedly um but
2:19 uh as the deputy secretary's chief of
2:20 staff and you know from that seat coming
2:23 back into government having been out um
2:25 working at tech companies was really
2:27 surprised at the place in the data
2:30 Journey the Department of Defense was
2:32 maybe I'll put it that way um and what a
2:34 lot of folks take for granted the kind
2:36 of availability of analytics to drive
2:39 decision-making the ability to test and
2:42 build um different types of applications
2:44 to meet internal or external needs
2:46 that's a lot harder in the government so
2:48 really have spent time in a variety of
2:50 roles inside the government first on the
2:52 deputy secretary's immediate staff sort
2:54 of helping build some of the foundations
2:56 and then in the acquisition roles um and
2:59 now in um as a chief digital and AI
3:01 officer really focused on trying to make
3:04 concrete progress um along that journey
3:07 to get the Department to be a place that
3:09 has datadriven Cutting Edge solutions to
3:12 all the full range of problems that
3:14 they're trying to deal with well let's
3:15 let's pick up on that for a minute and I
3:17 think um you know for a lot of us out
3:18 here in San Francisco could be um
3:20 acronym soup um looking at like the
3:22 Pentagon and this in incredibly large
3:24 organization with the services nested
3:26 underneath it can you just talk a little
3:28 bit about the origin of the cdao um
3:32 Mission today and then as you've come
3:34 into the seat over the past 6 months um
3:36 to to to lead it what are your
3:38 priorities kind of looking forward yeah
3:40 so I think the easiest way to think
3:42 about the Pentagon is a trillion dollar
3:45 War fighting and sort of uh Enterprise
3:48 wide machine really focused on two
3:50 things the sort of defeat adversaries
3:52 and maintain National Security and then
3:55 the manage uh you know 3 million person1
3:58 trillion ENT and all of the business
4:01 execution functions there in so just
4:03 starting there there are lots of
4:04 different parts of it there's an Air
4:05 Force there's a navy and there's um
4:08 what's called the office of the
4:09 secretary defense the core thing to
4:11 think about that is that's like the
4:12 cross cutting core platform team that
4:15 needs to build and maintain all of the
4:17 pieces the budget and financing the
4:19 Personnel that help all of those
4:22 action-oriented pieces keep moving cdao
4:25 really came from uh identifying when
4:28 when we came in in 2021 with the deputy
4:30 secretary the realization that we had
4:33 these real pockets of progress in the
4:35 Digital Data and AI spaces so we had a
4:38 defense digital service we had this
4:41 Enterprise analytics platform called
4:42 advana we had um The Joint AI Center the
4:46 Jake um and we so we had these teams
4:48 that were really we had Maven doing
4:50 really cutting edge work at the time on
4:51 on AI we had these teams that had pet of
4:54 excellence and we really needed to build
4:56 the foundation and scale that to have a
4:58 meaningful um ability to advance the
5:00 Department's Journey so that's really
5:02 the the where the cdao came from a
5:04 couple of sort of pockets of excellence
5:06 and the theory of the case that the sum
5:08 of the parts was greater um if we put
5:11 them all together so that you could have
5:12 the data data infra really than the data
5:15 analytics and the AI uh infra and the AI
5:19 applications all together with the
5:21 policies and Acquisitions that enable
5:24 that to come into the government in
5:25 scale and sort of that's where we are in
5:27 cdao in terms of my priorities if think
5:30 about cdao as in those functions to
5:32 enable the department to accelerate its
5:34 adoption to build the scaled foundations
5:37 for that and then to accelerate priority
5:40 applications our priorities are really
5:42 in that order right which is do we have
5:44 the right acquisition tools the right
5:46 policies the streamlined process for
5:48 atos all of the things that make it go
5:50 to enable that and then do we have the
5:52 right foundations the scaled data
5:55 infrastructure this the compute the um
5:58 the AI infrastructure the labeling data
6:00 the dev environments and then what are
6:02 our priorities in terms of applications
6:05 that we want to take our kind of limited
6:07 bandwidth and try to rapidly scale to
6:09 prove the value proposition of those
6:11 other two arms so the world's changed a
6:14 lot in the last call 18 to 24 months
6:16 November 22 um you know openi releases
6:19 chat gbt which came on the hills of you
6:21 know um gbt 3.5 and this explosion of um
6:26 of activity um you know not only from
6:29 the the model providers but also at the
6:30 hardware layer um and then open source
6:33 projects and an entirely new ecosystem
6:34 of tooling that's um that's that's
6:36 emerged since that time I know a lot of
6:39 the problems have remained the same over
6:41 the last several years um in terms of
6:43 you know Computing data what's changed
6:46 what sort of new opportunities are um
6:48 you know are unlocked with this new kind
6:50 of generation this paradigm shift and
6:52 technology that we've witnessed um and
6:54 how's the conversation shifted in
6:55 Washington around uh around this
6:57 technology there's a lot of enthusias
7:00 about sort of generative AI sort of
7:02 broadly but more the realization the of
7:07 the value that AI um Place poses the the
7:11 potential and some of the risk but a lot
7:13 of potential for transforming how the
7:16 government does business and and again
7:17 just going back to the two missions that
7:19 framing like it it has the potential to
7:22 transform War fighting but it also has
7:24 potential transformation on the
7:25 bureaucracy side to really help us
7:28 accelerate and um speed or um add rigor
7:31 to a number of our internal processes so
7:34 so the conversation is really focused on
7:36 how does the government Effective
7:39 Government generally and for us the
7:40 Department of Defense specifically make
7:43 meaningful progress into that to that
7:46 end a lot of what has changed for us is
7:48 focused on rather than buying things I I
7:51 like to say the way we would buy things
7:53 was basically from the app all the way
7:54 down the stack so we would buy these
7:56 vertically integrated hey I like that UI
7:58 I'm going to buy whole stack I like that
8:00 you I'm going to buy the whole stack a
8:02 lot of overlapping Investments on the
8:04 back end there because we're buying
8:06 these fully vertically integrated things
8:08 to having a more um Federated modular
8:12 interoperable model that has a lot more
8:14 providers and a lot more promise for
8:16 allowing our user base inside the
8:18 department decision makers or Warf
8:20 Fighters or operators or financial
8:22 planners to be able to selfs serve and
8:26 identify the solutions they need with
8:27 the underlying infrastructure investment
8:30 that allow that self-service model Y and
8:32 so I think that conversation has changed
8:34 the realization there's just a lot of
8:36 potential use cases yep and we need to
8:39 build the the enabling functions and
8:42 infrastructure to support users actually
8:44 using the the applications they want
8:47 that's that's really interesting so it
8:48 sounds like a lot of like bottomup
8:49 development and creating conditions for
8:51 success of you know this particular you
8:54 know airwing or this core may want to
8:56 develop an application how can we
8:57 provide the infrastructure to do that
8:59 and
9:00 broadly it's fitting into two different
9:01 buckets one might be um kind of like
9:04 back office business efficiency that's
9:06 and the other one is instead of
9:07 advancing like Topline uh let's call it
9:09 advancing deterrence instead of that's a
9:12 nice way of putting it advancing
9:14 deterrence and um but either way it's a
9:17 common set of potentially AI
9:19 infrastructure that's that that might um
9:22 you know sit underneath both of those
9:25 kind of buckets emission sets is that
9:26 right that's right um and you know you
9:27 can think about it I'll use just the
9:29 example of logistics because I think
9:30 it's something folks can resonate with
9:33 you know the department owns more
9:34 aircraft than Southwest more ground
9:36 vehicles and FedEx we have a supply
9:39 chain that has three times as many
9:40 suppliers as Walmart we have warehouses
9:43 all around the country and we need to be
9:45 able to move things around to them and
9:47 that's true for supporting the military
9:50 families who live on installations all
9:51 over the world and it's true for
9:53 maintaining fuel supplies for our ships
9:56 and planes and ground Vehicles right and
9:58 all of that
9:59 is relying on whether it's on the
10:02 operational side or on the management
10:04 business management side relies on the
10:06 same kind of underlying raw data sources
10:09 how you put them together and deliver
10:10 that for different uses is really the
10:13 question and how you make that you know
10:15 the the what the warehouse managers need
10:17 is going to look different than what the
10:19 fleet managers need when they're
10:20 maintaining fuel supplies but we want
10:23 them to have be able to build and have
10:25 be able to Source solutions to all of
10:27 their problems with a common uh set of
10:30 infrastructure Investments that make it
10:31 easier for them one thing that I'd love
10:34 to hear you talk a little bit more about
10:36 is that you know in the in the private
10:38 sector um compute has been a constraint
10:41 um and there's been enormous competition
10:44 over access to compute but there's this
10:46 like thriving ecosystem of players um
10:48 ranging from like the cloud service
10:50 providers to the hardware you know
10:52 manufacturers themselves to like the
10:53 core weaves of the world and others that
10:55 are um that are you know stepping up to
10:58 kind of meet that that demand um within
11:01 the Department of Defense and across the
11:02 services different environment right um
11:05 You have classified networks um you have
11:07 protected networks and um like priority
11:10 number one is protecting those networks
11:12 um but then you also need to kind of
11:14 Step Up to meet the um meet the moment
11:16 on how technology is changing and so
11:18 how's the department been like looking
11:20 at that unique challenge of how do you
11:22 like one buy all of this deploy all of
11:25 it operationalize it um so that you can
11:28 enable the folks um you know on the
11:30 front lines yeah so I we have we
11:33 certainly have unique problems in the or
11:35 unique um constraints in the department
11:38 we have these classified networks as you
11:40 said we have a sort of distributed
11:41 operations we have a lot of cyber
11:43 requirements rightly so um but I'll just
11:46 note like those are all problems that
11:47 exist in different ways in the private
11:49 sector right like different having
11:51 different people with different identity
11:53 and U like access to different kinds of
11:55 information is a problem that they solve
11:56 in healthcare and in finance and so in
11:59 the department I think there are a
12:01 couple things we have tried to do to get
12:03 better one is just try to have a clearer
12:06 process that goes from Solutions all the
12:09 way to fielding and the reason that is
12:12 is if there are solutions that people
12:13 have been thinking about in the
12:15 commercial sector we want to be able to
12:17 bring those Technology Solutions that
12:19 technologists into our environment to
12:22 help us solve them in order to do that
12:23 we need to have a process that walks
12:25 from we have a requirement we go out to
12:28 Industry and explain that re requirement
12:29 people come to us with potential
12:31 Solutions we can give you initial
12:33 funding whether it's through sort of
12:34 these small business or um smaller
12:37 contracts cbers are the common example
12:40 but there are a range of different
12:41 authorities see how that works test it
12:44 out if that looks good fund a prototype
12:47 if that looks good have a process to get
12:50 to either Enterprise scale with licenses
12:52 or to use it in the right environments
12:54 we need to be able to step through that
12:56 process in cdao we've been doing a lot
12:58 we have this initiative called dagger
12:59 it's a long acronym that relates to
13:01 having government-owned interoperable
13:03 repositories um for data and
13:05 applications um but the idea there is to
13:08 have this end to- endend process that
13:10 technologists can see from the beginning
13:13 getting all the way to the solution so
13:14 that's one big piece is just having that
13:16 the second is to try to start buying our
13:20 pieces of infrastructure in more modular
13:22 ways right so we don't want that
13:23 vertically integrated stack because it
13:26 creates a lot of constraints on what
13:27 Solutions are available to end users and
13:30 it buys the stack for the solution
13:32 rather than creating a stack and letting
13:34 more different kinds of solutions come
13:36 in and sort of democratizing that
13:38 process so what we're trying to do with
13:40 things like we have a program called
13:41 alpha 1 that's our AI infrastructure
13:43 program to actually try to fund okay
13:46 what are the pieces that need to come in
13:48 here data labeling or mlops right like
13:50 what are what are the core pieces we
13:52 need in that AI infrastructure how does
13:55 that fit with our data infrastructure
13:56 right now our data is very focused on
13:58 Analytics so we're also making some
14:00 Investments to have a more flexible back
14:02 end on the data side to enable um more
14:06 of that AI infrastructure to interact
14:07 with it but but you know so we but we
14:09 have to buy these in pieces and so we're
14:11 working our way through that in a couple
14:13 of different lines of effort we've done
14:14 it on our what we call Strategic command
14:17 and control that's on sort of
14:18 operational data we're now doing it on
14:20 Enterprise analytic data that has the as
14:22 I mentioned the warehouse data the
14:24 logistics the finance the Personnel data
14:27 and then we'll you know look at
14:28 different areas do that but that's kind
14:30 of the overall approach that's that's
14:32 really interesting and I think like what
14:33 is coming out of this conversation um is
14:36 that a lot of like when you know our
14:37 company um we we do a lot um with
14:40 private sector and especially like large
14:41 Enterprises and um the broader the broad
14:44 approach um seems very similar which is
14:47 like hey I'm going to you know they want
14:49 modular and interoperable solutions they
14:50 want to be able to um you know compose
14:53 their own AI platforms quickly um and be
14:56 able to swap in and out different
14:57 different providers the switching costs
14:58 are still pretty low right now right
14:59 there's not a lot of sunk Investments
15:02 necessarily on um like which LM you're
15:04 using or which vector or graph or
15:06 relational database you're may be using
15:08 or orchestration framework there still
15:10 like this is we're still in this this
15:12 period of like let's call it extreme
15:14 experimentation right and um and this
15:17 thriving ecosystem of companies many of
15:19 which are uh are represented here today
15:22 um you know are are adding to that and
15:24 advancing that and so like that's that's
15:26 great to hear around um you know kind of
15:29 aligning acquisition and broader
15:31 strategy towards making it you know easy
15:33 and fast to to plug in these
15:35 capabilities against these these
15:36 different Mission sets um maybe for the
15:39 benefit of everyone here and for for
15:40 myself just practically speaking how the
15:43 does DOD like at the cdao level
15:46 interface with what maybe Army's doing
15:49 and navy and Air Force um it can get a
15:52 little dizzzy just to understand who's
15:54 responsible for what and how do I plug
15:56 in being like a San Francisco based or
15:58 West Coast based tech company well the
16:00 short answer is we have a lot of
16:02 meetings a lot of them in 30 minute
16:04 increments um the the longer answer is
16:07 we have a couple of different I will
16:09 call them sort of bureaucratic
16:10 structures intend to pull intended to
16:12 pull these things together so the first
16:14 is we maintain inside cdao these
16:18 defense-wide program lines what that
16:20 means concretely is Congress gives us
16:22 money we get all our money from Congress
16:24 Congress gives us money for defense-wide
16:26 investments in infrastructure and
16:28 Enterprise licenses that allows us to
16:31 take needs from other folks like armies
16:33 or the combatant commands like Special
16:35 Operations Command or Central Command or
16:37 european command to come to us to say
16:39 hey you guys were given resources to
16:41 help us we have this significant need we
16:43 validate those needs and we fund them
16:44 and then buy you know Enterprise
16:46 licenses at scale to try to maximize
16:48 buying power but also to get a common
16:50 sort of set of tools available for folks
16:53 so through that process of sort of
16:55 budget review and allocation and needs
16:57 Taking in we get to understand the
17:00 enterprise-wide requirements so that we
17:02 can just like just like really any large
17:04 organization right prioritize racket
17:05 stack the second piece and probably more
17:07 interesting for this group is CDO one of
17:10 the functions we serve is as the chief
17:11 data officer for the department and in
17:13 that we just have a a lot of uh powers
17:16 of compelling people to do things just
17:19 handy give us your data yes data I have
17:22 a actually a my 5-year-old made me a
17:23 magic wand which I can I like to cadow
17:26 things the DAT yeah like cadow
17:29 um and so but in that context we spend a
17:32 lot of times working with the military
17:34 departments so the Army and the Navy and
17:36 the Air Force um and and understanding
17:39 what they're doing and building where it
17:41 makes sense to have uh sort of
17:44 foundational layer of investment that
17:46 connects the different data sources and
17:47 where there are service unique service
17:50 specific activities that they should be
17:51 doing and how those architectures
17:53 connect um I talk about it in the
17:55 architecture sense because in some ways
17:58 we we don't need to and it's actually a
18:00 feature not a bug that we're not
18:02 involved all the way at the application
18:03 side right by the time we get to the
18:05 applications unless it's so ubiquitous
18:08 like that everyone needs to have it for
18:10 us to all operate together think you
18:12 know document sharing Etc but beyond
18:15 that we really want to allow and enable
18:17 this sort of self-service application
18:20 procurement and deployment and testing
18:22 and experimentation so that people are
18:24 getting fit for purpose applications we
18:26 just don't want to duplicate where we
18:28 can want to minimize duplication on the
18:30 layers below that so we spend a lot of
18:33 time with the with the military
18:34 departments making sure that their
18:36 service Centric architecture that's
18:38 focused on feeding those application
18:40 needs intersects effectively with our
18:43 department-wide one that they're
18:44 interoperable that the data can flow
18:46 between them and that we're not
18:47 duplicating Investments for folks who
18:49 are kind of at the infrastructure layer
18:51 what that means is two things one CDO
18:54 can be a helpful front door which is
18:56 even if you we don't Your solution isn't
18:58 a solution that is for a Enterprise
19:00 level solution knowing what is available
19:02 and out there in the marketplace is
19:04 helpful for us because we can be a
19:06 useful Matchmaker and the second is in
19:08 Reverse which is if you're working with
19:10 clients in you know in the military in
19:13 the army or in the Navy and you've got a
19:15 solution that you think can Port we can
19:17 help Port that we have things like you
19:19 know atto reciprocity we have our own
19:21 authorizing official we have our own
19:23 acquisition authori so we can help pull
19:25 things across that transm where it can
19:27 be hard when you've got a solution for
19:30 one particular customer in the
19:31 department to help figure out if it's
19:33 appropriate to scale how do we scale it
19:35 what do that look like makes total sense
19:37 I think um one thing and we'll make sure
19:40 we budget a little bit of time for for
19:41 questions here but um one thing I wanted
19:43 to touch on is that this um this tension
19:46 um red between an imper and I I see this
19:48 in the um in the private sector a lot is
19:51 an imperative to adopt competition among
19:53 you know um among companies for one um
19:55 in within Industries um with also a need
19:58 do it responsibly and responsible Ai and
20:00 so how's the administration how is the
20:03 department how is cdio kind of
20:05 approaching um those twin goals and and
20:08 how they navigate that it's a good
20:09 question I'm actually just coming from
20:10 Soul where there was a sort of U
20:12 multinational responsible AI conference
20:15 reame um and I say that to say this is a
20:18 huge topic for governments across the
20:20 world industry and civil society and
20:22 it's a I think an opportunity for us to
20:24 fit together I um you know DOD was the
20:28 first milit in the world I think to
20:30 adopt these ethical principles of AI in
20:32 2020 we have a responsible AI team
20:35 that's really focused on Translating
20:37 that strategy into implementable things
20:40 we have a toolkit um that toolkit is
20:43 really intended to cover the full life
20:44 cycle of tools across you know from
20:47 initial design and development sort of
20:49 responsibility by Design all the way
20:51 through to test and evaluation
20:52 deployment and Fielding to make sure we
20:54 have things like hey if you want to
20:56 monit monitor your model once you
20:57 fielded it like what is does that look
20:59 like what should you look for in model
21:00 monitoring services so all the way
21:01 across that that is like kind of at a
21:04 tactical level the how because I think
21:06 AI is a good example of a technology
21:09 where policy the words policy isn't
21:12 isn't enough you need to know the words
21:14 you need to have those values based
21:16 principles but you need to translate
21:18 that into Technical Solutions or it's
21:20 not going to be baked into the actual
21:22 digital Solution that's deployed and
21:24 fielded but at an even higher level I
21:27 think you know a lot of times people ask
21:29 like oh how you know are what are you
21:32 doing to to deal with the fact that
21:34 responsible AI slows you down or
21:36 inhibits adoption or limits what you can
21:38 adopt and I I just I challenge folks to
21:40 really turn that question around which
21:42 is what is it we're slowing down if
21:45 responsibility things like traceability
21:47 and governance of your AI what are you
21:48 slowing down irresponsible AI like
21:51 models that don't perform the things you
21:53 want or in the ways you want in ways
21:55 that you can't verify and validate like
21:57 so the question isn't really are we
21:59 slowing things down the question is how
22:01 do you translate those values and
22:03 principles that are really like
22:05 Universal they're not super
22:07 controversial they're not really owned
22:09 by a particular country or company how
22:11 do you translate those into actions so
22:13 that people know how to from the get-go
22:16 build in the design and the deployment
22:19 all the way through the life cycle and
22:20 that's really where the toolkit comes
22:21 from which is we know we need these so
22:24 let's just tell you how to do it so we
22:25 can get on with the development and
22:27 deployment makes sense awesome okay I'm
22:30 looking at our clock we got uh we got
22:32 about 3 and a half 4 minutes left um
22:34 organizers are we able to do a couple
22:36 couple questions does that does that
22:37 work I know we got a big crowd here but
22:39 we love to make time for a couple at
22:42 least um go for
22:44 it yeah you know there's a lot of
22:47 startups here and we would love to work
22:51 with you or with the federal government
22:55 especially the urgency of you know the
22:57 ad
22:59 said you guys have a lot of data I'm
23:00 sure you want to operationalize it so
23:03 how can many startups and you know many
23:06 of them are vent funded they just don't
23:08 know how to work with federal government
23:10 so can you give us some email or
23:12 somebody you talk to or your
23:15 email let's give them let's give them
23:17 Dan's email yeah so we're I'm not going
23:19 to give you my email but uh so just for
23:21 the purposes of folks who might not be
23:23 able to hear because there wasn't
23:24 there's not a mic the question is like
23:25 how do you work with the federal
23:26 government and the Department of Defense
23:27 in particular um two two answers to that
23:30 one is uh we we have a process in
23:34 general it's an acquisition process
23:36 inside cdao we have a particular
23:39 acquisition toolkit we're using called
23:41 trade win so if you Google tradewins AI
23:43 it will come up it has contact
23:45 information it has information on our
23:47 industry days and and how to access Us
23:49 and how to work with us and how to sign
23:50 up for those we have the next one I
23:52 think next week in DC but I think we
23:54 have one planned for California later in
23:56 this fall I'm going to roughly say
23:58 november-ish but you should check the
23:59 website cuz I don't recall off the top
24:01 of my head um so that's like just one
24:02 bucket to understand like that we do
24:04 have a front door there we also have a
24:06 front door with uh we have an Mo uh
24:08 memorandum of agreement with the defense
24:10 Innovation unit um to help them to sort
24:12 of serve at for them to serve as a front
24:14 door for us here in California so that's
24:16 just a second option and again that is
24:18 also available on the tradewin site so
24:20 you don't have to go somewhere else more
24:21 broadly though I'll just say um the
24:25 whole part of what we're trying to do in
24:26 CDO is make the government less hard to
24:28 work with which is a lofty goal but I
24:30 think what what that means is really to
24:33 try to set up the point of these
24:34 industry days the point of having that
24:36 website is to sort of demystify the
24:38 process look the bottom line is we have
24:40 money and we need to put those on
24:42 contract vehicles and then get the right
24:44 approvals to use technology so the first
24:46 step in the contract vehicle is getting
24:48 initial funding so that you can prove
24:50 your technology solution works we do
24:52 those through challenges inside CD but
24:54 those are relatively small dollar things
24:56 that just help us test your environment
24:58 if your tool seems like it's a good idea
25:00 or your technology solution then we can
25:02 move to a prototype and those are
25:04 slightly longer contracts slightly
25:05 bigger dollars and relatively low
25:07 thresholds the term we use is these
25:09 other transaction authorities OTAs um
25:12 and they just are a streamlined process
25:14 and the trade win site again is intended
25:16 to uh streamline the way you can get
25:18 into those by having more normal pitches
25:20 like videos and and uh streamlined
25:23 documents rather than the longer
25:24 traditional contract pitches that I will
25:27 just now Trail off when talk about um
25:29 and then once you get there then you
25:30 know you have your evaluation and your
25:32 authority to operate again we've tried
25:33 to in cdao we have an authorizing
25:35 official so if we have useful Solutions
25:38 we can figure out how to approve them we
25:40 have Enterprise level contract vehicles
25:42 and we know the ones that we don't have
25:44 so we can help match you to those longer
25:46 term Vehicles if the solutions prove
25:48 scalable but there's just kind of steps
25:50 along in the process um and you know the
25:53 last thing I'll just close with is a lot
25:54 of times we talk about the defense
25:55 budget with the planning is really far
25:57 out and it you know makes it hard for
25:59 startups the truth is that is for scaled
26:03 large programs that need billions of
26:06 dollars to sustain and those don't
26:08 happen overnight so the steps I'm
26:10 talking about are really ways where we
26:12 can knowing what we're going to need to
26:14 years from now we can start investing
26:16 going on the investment pathway for you
26:18 know 24 to 36 months beforehand with
26:21 clear contracts and approval processes
26:24 to meet the budget where we get to to
26:26 help close that Gap and so that's kind
26:28 of the arc we're trying to bring folks
26:29 on with having a front door like the
26:31 trade wi site amazing time flew by thank
26:34 you so much thank you everybody for
26:36 leaning in and um have a great
26:38 conference
26:40 thanks I dropped it
