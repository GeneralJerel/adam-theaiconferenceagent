0:15 Hackday is kind of like a game show. The
0:17 idea is we bring together a bunch of
0:19 synergistic companies to help augment
0:20 the generative AI stack and give
0:22 developers the opportunity to get
0:24 hands-on with these technology with the
0:25 experts in the room with them. So, we've
0:27 got a variety of challenges that go
0:28 throughout the day from uh mini hacker
0:31 challenges to full-on demos, social
0:32 media challenges, etc. The whole vibe is
0:35 we got to get developers engaged and
0:36 loving the new tech that we're building
0:38 together as a community.
0:48 Uh we run currently one half night per
0:51 month at the GitHub office. Those have
0:52 kind of been the inspiration for doing a
0:54 half day with AI conference. AI
0:56 conference is kind of our partner in
0:58 crime so to speak. They help us build
0:59 fill out some of the branding around
1:00 hack day and AI conference together and
1:02 then in turn we also try to create an
1:04 opportunity for AI conference goers to
1:06 get the opportunity to hack and do
1:08 really cool stuff with the technology
1:09 and do something really hands-on.
1:12 I'm really excited to see all of the
1:14 developers demos. Uh they've been
1:16 building out some really really exciting
1:17 things. Just absolutely stoked to see
1:19 that.
