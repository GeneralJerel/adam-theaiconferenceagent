0:11 Okay. Hey Erin, how's it going?
0:14 Fantastic. So nice to meet you. Thank
0:15 you for having me.
0:17 Thanks for being here, taking time for
0:19 us. Um, so I know you're speaking at the
0:21 conference. We're we're about two weeks
0:24 away as we record this and I'm uh on the
0:27 on the rat wheel spinning frantically
0:30 right now, but uh love love the fact
0:31 that we get to talk to you a little bit
0:33 and um you know get to hear some of some
0:35 of your thoughts on how things are
0:36 going. So um maybe maybe we could just
0:39 start by just telling telling uh you
0:41 just telling us what you do and what
0:43 you've been doing up to at Amazon.
0:45 Absolutely. So I am a very longtime
0:47 Amazonian. Uh I will hit my 25 year
0:50 anniversary at Amazon in October. Uh so
0:53 it's it's been a it's been a crazy ride,
0:55 my friend. Um I started as a web
0:58 developer in the year 2000 in the music
1:00 part of the website. Uh and then over
1:03 time I've worked in different tech teams
1:04 largely on the retail side of the house
1:06 for about 20 years. The last uh three
1:10 years I was the head of product for
1:12 Amazon's internal software development
1:14 tooling team. And it was in that role
1:17 that I actually started getting involved
1:19 in the AI space. So, uh, Amazon, like
1:22 everyone else, got, uh, you know, as all
1:25 of these coding tools and things were
1:26 starting to come out, we're like, "Oh,
1:28 those look great. Let's let's see what
1:29 we can do with them." And so, I got
1:31 pulled in on a lot of those
1:32 conversations and just uh, this
1:36 technology is like nothing I've seen
1:37 before. It's amazing. Um, and there's so
1:40 much potential, but I think it's one
1:42 that there's we need to do some
1:45 thoughtful engineering and shaping
1:46 around. So, earlier this year, I joined
1:50 what is now called the Agentic AI
1:52 organization within AWS. Uh, my role is
1:55 I'm a product manager. Uh, I do a lot of
1:57 things like uh tech strategy, product
2:00 strategy work. Um, work across a fairly
2:02 large portfolio. uh but get involved in
2:07 uh a lot of you know applied tech. How
2:09 do we take this innovation and really
2:13 make it something that's really high
2:16 utility for the world?
2:18 Yeah. Which is you know an kind of
2:21 unparalleled opportunity to do that
2:23 stuff. Now are you so you're you're
2:26 customerf facing in your are you
2:28 internal or you customerf facing?
2:30 That's a great question. I my my role
2:31 actually is is both. Uh so I work very
2:34 you know I'm embedded within the product
2:36 team. I work you know directly daytoday
2:39 with uh with the product teams as
2:41 they're building but I also have the
2:43 privilege of working both across Amazon
2:45 because there's some amazing things
2:47 going on here but also I get to interact
2:49 with our customers a lot uh and have
2:51 just met some really amazing
2:54 uh very innovative uh customers who are
2:58 who are doing some really cool things
3:00 with this technology.
3:02 Yeah, I can imagine. I mean the you've
3:03 you've seen Amazon go through so much
3:05 and that's that's sort of the isn't is
3:07 that the genesis story of AWS itself is
3:09 like hey we built this amazing scalable
3:11 infrastructure maybe we should sell it
3:13 to customers and now you're doing the
3:14 same thing with AI or
3:16 you know I think there's absolutely
3:17 truth to that you know I think there's
3:18 also you know some some truth to there
3:20 was just you know sort of clear uh
3:22 opportunity out the industry but of
3:24 course we did have the um we had the
3:29 experience to do it well and you I think
3:33 when uh you know in the AI space as well
3:37 um obviously there's a ton of amazing
3:40 innovation going on across the industry
3:42 there's been some amazing breakthroughs
3:43 particularly coming out a lot of these
3:45 you know science startups and things
3:46 like that that we all owe a lot to but
3:50 uh Amazon has been a a sort of a big
3:53 data user for decades and um it's it's
3:56 just the bread and butter of how we run
3:59 so when this tech tech came along, we're
4:03 like, "Oh, cool." Like, we see some
4:05 things we could do with that. And, you
4:07 know, it's not always the most sexy
4:08 thing to do with it, but it is like just
4:11 like it's such a powerhouse to solve
4:14 problems in ways we've never been able
4:16 to solve before. So, even within Amazon,
4:19 you know, there's these like, well,
4:20 where do you use AI? I'm like, where are
4:22 we not using it? Where are we not
4:24 experimenting with it? Where have we not
4:26 put it into production? Like, it's
4:28 everywhere.
4:30 um and you different levels of maturity
4:32 doing all sorts of different tasks. Um
4:35 so you know for me you know in the space
4:37 that we're working in Amazon itself is
4:40 an interesting petri dish for how we
4:43 take this uh you know truly innovative
4:46 you know data science work and combine
4:48 it with really solid thoughtful
4:50 engineering to produce like as I say
4:54 really high utility results
4:57 makes makes a ton of sense. I I I can't
5:00 imagine the kind of stuff that you're
5:01 that you're working on, the data that
5:02 you have access to. So, it's super it
5:06 must be super cool. Um, one of the
5:08 things I saw in your in your abstract
5:10 that that hit me was just the idea of
5:11 the of the Renaissance worker,
5:13 right?
5:14 Um, and I know you studied art history,
5:16 right? So, that's
5:17 I did. I did. Uh, yeah.
5:20 You know, I I got hired at Amazon at a
5:22 time when uh we'll just say technology
5:25 education hadn't caught up with the the
5:27 needs of the industry. kind of at
5:28 that.com boom. And so, you know, there
5:30 was a whole bunch of us who had liberal
5:32 arts degrees that were self-taught
5:34 technologists and and came into the
5:36 industry. And, you know, of course,
5:37 there's still a few of us hanging
5:38 around. Um, yes.
5:40 But, you know, I I think that um you
5:44 Amazon has had this culture of two pizza
5:46 teams for oh, I want to say they they
5:49 showed up in I want to say 2003 2004
5:52 era. Um, I know when when they first
5:54 showed up, we were all like, "What?" Um
5:57 and then of course now they're they're
5:58 so core to how we function. But um you
6:03 know one of the premises of a two pizza
6:05 team is really a this idea of sort of a
6:10 fully encapsulated
6:12 group that's empowered to really move
6:15 the needle on a problem space.
6:18 But I think what we found as technology
6:21 has got more complex, as there's just
6:23 more to know, as problem spaces have
6:25 gotten harder to deal with, uh, as you
6:28 know, security and resilience and all of
6:31 our expectations continue to go up, the
6:34 autonomy of two pizza teams has been
6:36 it's been a hard one battle to kind of
6:39 keep that going. Um, and you end up
6:42 getting all these weird interconnects,
6:45 right? like, oh, well, I can get this
6:46 far, but now I need to bring in security
6:48 expertise, or I can get this far, but
6:51 now I need to bring in somebody who's
6:53 able to go really do the market
6:54 research. Um and
6:58 you know and I think this is it's it's
7:00 you know at Amazon's really large scale
7:02 this is what a lot of startups a lot of
7:04 people who are in a place of their
7:07 passion who are like hey I want to get
7:09 going on building a solution you know
7:11 have historically had this this dilemma
7:14 of well I can either be a deep tech
7:17 expert and know how to make the
7:18 computers do the things
7:20 right
7:20 or I can be a domain expert but those
7:23 unicorns who can do both well and still
7:27 sleep um is a hard and I I think when we
7:32 look at this technology and the the
7:35 promise that we're starting to see in it
7:37 and the start promise that we're
7:38 starting to realize in it we're getting
7:41 back to this idea of enabling smart
7:45 people with great ideas to really use
7:47 these tools as tools
7:49 and not have to be deep technology
7:52 experts in order to at security and
7:55 resilience and you know scalability and
7:58 all of that stuff out of them.
8:00 Yeah, that's a super good point. I one
8:03 of the things we're seeing as a pattern
8:05 um this year in the conference is an
8:06 explosion of what we call uh innovator
8:10 exhibitors. So they're pe they're people
8:12 that we have this special pla uh you
8:15 know kind of class of exhibitor that is
8:17 very small. they have to qualify for it
8:20 and so we h we've really not had very
8:22 many of them. These are these are very
8:24 early stage startup a lot of time
8:26 preunding and um we weren't we weren't
8:29 really focused on it the last two years
8:31 because all the big companies are there
8:33 and they're you know they're put they're
8:34 taking up the space. This year we just
8:36 saw this massive to your point, right?
8:38 We just saw this massive influx and we
8:40 we actually had to start reconfiguring
8:42 the the exhibit hall to take out some of
8:45 the big booths because we were just
8:48 getting this, you know, windfall of uh
8:51 of requests for these small companies or
8:53 these or even solo, you know, solo folks
8:55 that are just literally they have a
8:57 working SAS system that they built
9:00 themselves with, you know, with AI. So,
9:04 um, yeah, 100% exactly what you're
9:06 saying. And
9:07 you were just in a planning meeting, uh,
9:09 yesterday thinking, trying to think
9:11 through what 2026 looks like. And I was
9:13 saying, you know,
9:14 I think every, you know, I just think
9:16 it's hard to predict, but I think
9:19 everybody with an idea will be able to
9:21 pursue that and actually build something
9:23 useful and it'll be really interesting
9:24 to see. So, I think that we're just
9:26 going to see this explosion of of of
9:28 stuff of companies and and useful
9:31 things. Is is that kind of how you how
9:33 you see this agentic thing playing out?
9:35 I
9:35 I I do. I mean, if you think about the
9:37 early days of the web, right, the
9:38 companies that that were really big at
9:40 the time were were the companies that
9:41 were building the core tech itself,
9:43 right? You know, you're you certainly
9:45 you did have companies like Amazon that
9:47 were doing retail audit and things like
9:48 that. But, you know, as as you say, we
9:51 we even got into AWS pretty fast, right?
9:54 Um and you know so but then we started
9:57 seeing innovation on top of that
10:00 technology right this is where our door
10:01 dashes started popping up and Ubers and
10:04 Lyfts and you know inuits and and all
10:07 sorts of service you know companies that
10:11 of course have technology at their heart
10:14 but their purpose is in service of a
10:18 greater need
10:19 right
10:20 and I I I completely agree with you
10:22 we're going to see that with AI too,
10:24 right? You know, the last couple of
10:25 years we've been seeing this sort of
10:27 like how do we build the core tech
10:29 itself, but now we get to transition to
10:33 the what are those amazing ideas that
10:36 people are now able to dive into because
10:39 this tech exists and didn't before.
10:43 Yeah, it's it's super interesting to
10:44 think about because like you said, you
10:46 know, I mean, it's funny because I've
10:48 been I've been buying stuff from Amazon
10:49 since 2000, I think. I think maybe 99
10:52 but I think 2000 just just books I I
10:55 remember and and watching you know the
10:58 evolution of Amazon basically becoming
11:01 one of the best technology companies in
11:04 the world because it had to
11:05 because we had to
11:07 it had had no choice and and yeah to
11:09 your point we're we're we're starting to
11:12 see that future where
11:14 you might not have to or you don't have
11:16 to anymore to to service you know
11:19 to sell an enormous number of books or
11:21 products, you don't have to do that
11:23 anymore, which is going to be quite
11:24 interesting, right?
11:25 You know, I think that for every um
11:27 every service provider, you're your goal
11:30 is always to take really great care of
11:32 your customers at an increasingly large
11:35 scale without losing that fidelity of
11:37 care.
11:38 And that that's a a really big
11:42 challenge, right? that is, you know,
11:44 it's it's a huge
11:48 headwind for companies to scale to be
11:52 able to serve more customers well. And I
11:55 think that what we get to see with this
11:57 technology and its ability to do things
11:59 like, you know, rapidly collate data and
12:02 provide insights or, you know, be
12:06 proactive about following up with
12:08 customers or um, you know, gathering
12:12 data from the folks who are out in the
12:14 field with customers and making sure
12:16 that that gets into the right place and
12:18 used the right way. it it's a such an
12:21 enabler for anybody who's building
12:24 customer services which is pretty much
12:25 anyone right we all live in service of
12:27 others um to to take great care of their
12:32 customers at scale uh and you know that
12:35 that's obviously been the impetus for a
12:36 lot of Amazon's technology innovation
12:39 over the years is how do we continue to
12:41 have fidelity of taking care of our
12:42 customers at scale um
12:45 and you know why we ended up in ML and
12:47 why AI is interesting to address and all
12:50 that stuff,
12:51 right? So, what uh I mean I know you
12:54 oversee a lot of stuff and and product
12:56 management is your is your focus. Um can
12:59 you tell us about sort of like the stuff
13:01 that you're working on or what what what
13:04 is going to make it into or how how is
13:06 it going to be used I suppose in the
13:07 next few months or what's being used
13:09 now?
13:10 So, you know obviously the the tip of
13:11 the spear has been in the developer
13:13 space. Um, you know, I think that that
13:15 is uh sort of a no-brainer uh because
13:18 you say see technologists building for
13:19 their own problems initially and it's
13:22 also uh a very datarich environment
13:24 fairly well structured. So it has all of
13:27 the sweet spot attributes that make AI
13:29 work really well. Um you know so I think
13:33 so that I think has been teaching us a
13:36 lot you know both in Amazon and across
13:38 the industry over the last couple of
13:40 years. Uh but you know we'll just say
13:42 that some of our our non- tech peers are
13:44 looking on um at our our work with envy
13:47 and saying well when can I get something
13:48 that cool too um and you know even you
13:52 know adaptation of tools initially built
13:54 for uh you know tech problems um in in
13:58 others like my single favorite AI tool
14:01 is QCLI like I use that to
14:06 for things that it was never intended to
14:08 be used for um but it's got access to my
14:11 file system. I have all sorts of bizarre
14:13 workflows with it using markdown files
14:15 and things like that. Um but so I think
14:18 that we're going to start seeing um so
14:22 one as these coding agents and the
14:24 patterns of using them get more reliable
14:27 where you really truly can use sort of
14:30 natural language description to describe
14:32 the technology that you want to have
14:34 built and have good expectations that a
14:38 that a good tech artifact is going to
14:39 come out of that. You're going to enable
14:43 smart people who have business problems
14:45 to actually build tech to solve their
14:47 own problems, right?
14:48 I'm going to acknowledge I haven't coded
14:51 professionally
14:53 probably for over a decade. Um, but I'm
14:56 now coding again, which one for me is
15:00 super fun because I can now solve my own
15:02 problems with with tech. And I, you
15:03 know, like I appreciate I'm not the
15:06 poster child of a non- tech worker
15:08 because obviously I've been working
15:10 technology. Um, but what I get to see
15:14 there is the promise of kind of the arc
15:18 of evolution of this stuff. Um, you
15:20 know, I think the other examples we're
15:23 seeing, uh, I think research agents are
15:25 really interesting. Um uh we've been
15:29 having a lot of uh a lot of enthusiasm
15:32 and experimentation with those
15:33 internally uh up to and including our
15:35 executives um who you know of course
15:38 executives of a large company uh in
15:40 general end up getting into the point
15:42 where they're they're reading reports.
15:43 They're not doing the primary research.
15:45 They're you know stuff is being brought
15:47 to them. And we're now seeing uh a bunch
15:50 of our execs using these research agents
15:52 like on the side to do their own
15:54 research. And so you'll show up in a
15:57 meeting with an executive and they're
15:58 like yeah I went I went and did this
15:59 research and you're like
16:01 that's awesome right like that that's
16:04 outstanding but you also get to see it
16:07 at the other end of the scale right so
16:09 you've got uh you know
16:11 sort of day-to-day you know workers who
16:15 get the same set of tools
16:18 um and so I I you know those types of
16:20 things like you know I was uh super
16:24 interested in exploring the potential of
16:27 better multilingual support. Um, and so
16:30 I I threw that against a research agent
16:32 the other day and it made a really
16:34 compelling case that I should be leaning
16:35 into that more. Um, and I'm like that
16:38 sounds great. I I think uh multilingual,
16:40 you know, I am worried that right now
16:43 natural language
16:45 for the most part means English.
16:47 Yeah.
16:48 um to really get the most out of these
16:51 models at this moment in time. You know,
16:53 the research says that you need to be
16:56 prompting in English and I think that is
16:59 a massive area of opportunity to really
17:01 enable the world um
17:03 to do things. Um but to go back to your
17:06 question, you know, I I do think that,
17:08 you know, the ability to explore data,
17:10 the ability to, you know, like build an
17:14 arbitrary dashboard, right, without
17:16 really having to be, you know, a
17:19 business intelligence engineer. Um
17:22 the ability to explore your curiosity
17:27 um and then be able to do something
17:29 about it is you know particularly at at
17:32 really big companies like sometimes it
17:34 can feel difficult to do
17:38 company you may feel like you don't you
17:40 have historically not had the resources
17:41 to do it.
17:42 Yeah.
17:43 And suddenly you can.
17:45 So yeah that's interesting. How do you
17:48 um have you have you seen examples where
17:51 that's that's happening within Amazon or
17:52 in a AWS where um either an executive or
17:56 somebody that's traditionally
17:57 non-technical has built something and
17:59 and now it's actually being used or
18:01 become part of the the standard.
18:04 I'm I'm going to give you a silly
18:06 example, but you know maybe one that
18:07 that's illustrative of uh you know sort
18:10 of some of the possibilities. So, Amazon
18:13 uh we've got this thing called the phone
18:14 tool and uh in the phone tool there are
18:18 phone tool icons and phone tool icons
18:20 are very prized. uh they're um you if
18:23 you go back to the early 2000s the
18:25 concept of ego boo uh you've got you
18:27 know basically this sorry way back um I
18:31 worked in the reputation team for a
18:33 while so um it's you know so phone tool
18:38 icons uh at Amazon motivate behavior uh
18:42 it's it's just one of these things right
18:44 and um we wanted you know to ex
18:48 encourage
18:50 all of Amazon's
18:52 workers uh to really lean into using AI
18:57 tools because you know we kind of see
18:58 this as a virtuous cycle. As our own
19:01 workforce becomes increasingly
19:02 comfortable with AI, they start thinking
19:04 about how to use it to solve problems in
19:06 different ways. So we knew that one of
19:09 the ways to strongly encourage people at
19:11 Amazon to play around with AI tools was
19:15 to give them phone tool icons. Now,
19:17 historically to build the data pull, you
19:20 know, data queries and all of that
19:22 stuff, we would have expected that there
19:24 needed to be some dev team that would
19:27 have had to go build this like, you
19:29 know, leaderboards and all of that
19:31 stuff.
19:32 Well, one of our product managers did it
19:34 with Curo over the weekend.
19:37 Nice. And so it's like, you know, I know
19:39 it's a silly example, but like it's just
19:41 that like we knew that that was
19:43 important from a cultural perspective,
19:44 but it was one of these things like when
19:46 am I ever going to get a dev team to
19:47 prioritize building phone tool icons,
19:50 right?
19:51 Um, but sure enough, do I check where
19:53 I'm at on leaderboards? Oh, of course I
19:55 do. I'm I'm working on that next icon.
19:58 So the phone Okay, so phone tool is
20:00 something that everybody uses all the
20:01 time.
20:02 All the time. and and the icon, you
20:05 know, it's basically like the bragging
20:07 rights of having the icon.
20:08 The bragging rights, right? And you can
20:10 get them for all sorts of things. And in
20:11 the sentence, we wanted to get them to
20:13 encourage exploration of AI tools.
20:15 Yeah.
20:16 And so,
20:18 and so someone built some Yeah. Well, I
20:21 think what you know 100% what you're
20:23 saying like um
20:25 you know is very resonates a lot with me
20:27 because you know building a building an
20:30 AI startup in 2012 in hard mode you know
20:33 we had this massive list of of things
20:35 that we wanted to do and no time you
20:37 know and stuff like that. Yes. They they
20:40 always as you you know you you always
20:42 got your punch list of like the sharp
20:45 edges and those those launch blockers
20:47 and those things that build community,
20:50 those things that you create great
20:52 engagement, those things that that those
20:54 soft parts of a product that actually
20:57 really make or break what you're doing.
21:00 It's so hard to prioritize them.
21:02 Yep. They get they get shoved away and
21:04 Yeah. Absolutely. Some little bit of
21:06 magic gets lost.
21:08 Exactly. And so now you can, right?
21:11 Because now you can go have Curo or
21:14 Claude Code or whatever. Go just do it
21:17 for you
21:18 and it just works.
21:20 It just works and Yeah. It's amazing.
21:22 Yeah. So how do you think um so when you
21:25 think of this Renaissance worker concept
21:27 is it
21:28 Yeah. How do you think it changes like
21:30 the organization? Is it obviously a lot
21:32 of people are worried about you know
21:34 teams going from you know 50 people to
21:36 one person but what do what do you see
21:39 on that
21:40 you know I think um I guess I think I
21:42 see AI agents in a little bit more
21:44 synergistic uh relationship um
21:49 certainly as the technology evolves
21:52 they'll function with increasing
21:54 autonomy
21:55 but you know I think they're um we'll
21:58 say they're complimentary to the way
22:00 that humans
22:01 think
22:03 um and you know I do think that you know
22:07 going back to like Amazon's two-piece
22:09 team structure right
22:11 uh
22:13 I think they get us you know for a
22:15 company like our size it actually gets
22:17 us back to the way we like to operate um
22:21 with greater agility to be able to
22:23 notice and respond to what our customers
22:26 need with more agility
22:28 um because you as I over time you
22:31 particularly again at at a company like
22:33 our size uh that sort of long list of
22:38 mustd do stuff is never ending right
22:40 there's always security patches there's
22:42 always resilience work there's always
22:43 region expansion there's always
22:45 all of these things that um are
22:49 absolutely critical and very hard to say
22:52 no to and in fact you really can't say
22:54 no to them
22:55 right
22:55 um but as we get to a world where
23:00 those things are easier to automate with
23:05 kind of certainty and trust
23:06 trustworthiness,
23:08 right?
23:09 I think that allows humans to be their
23:13 best selves. Um and that is you know
23:18 being matrix thinkers uh you know
23:20 thinking innovatively noticing problems
23:24 talking to their customers and then
23:26 being able to actually not just have
23:29 this long wish list of things they want
23:31 to do but turn that wish list into
23:34 action which earns their customers trust
23:37 you know shows a level of agility and
23:39 resilience and you know that that's the
23:42 the future I'm I'm excited about you I I
23:45 appreciate there's
23:47 all sorts of different points of view on
23:49 what the AI future looks like. Um,
23:53 but I I tend to be hopeful.
23:55 Yeah. No, I think I mean, well, it's
23:57 interesting that some of the stuff we're
23:59 saying, how how big is a TPC team
24:01 normally?
24:02 So, two pizza teams, you know,
24:04 traditionally, uh, you know, you should
24:06 be able to feed them with two pizzas.
24:08 So, typically it's going to be six to
24:09 eight people.
24:10 Gotcha. Yeah. Um
24:12 yeah things
24:13 and you know
24:14 right and ideally it's composed of the
24:17 right types of people to tackle whatever
24:20 job you know whatever problem set you've
24:22 got um you know historically that may
24:26 have been like couple you know test
24:28 engineers software engineers some web
24:30 developers product folks um but as I say
24:35 as we've
24:37 needed specialization
24:39 you know deep security expert
24:41 you know, how do I make this resilient
24:43 at a global scale? Uh, it's tough to fit
24:46 all of that into two pizzas.
24:48 Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. So,
24:51 it's interesting. So, you're you're kind
24:52 of thinking that what what AI unlocks
24:55 for us here is
24:58 kind of shouldering some of the burden
25:00 that those teams get saddled up with in
25:03 a large organization. And maybe it maybe
25:06 it is unlocks more pro productivity by
25:08 either handling that stuff or being the
25:10 expert or
25:11 right
25:12 and also to allow experts to sort of
25:14 amplify themselves right like I don't
25:17 think any of us will ever say we have
25:19 enough security engineers ever
25:22 right and we always want more
25:24 and um that you know there will
25:28 literally never be enough security
25:30 engineers on the planet.
25:32 There you go. people that want to know
25:33 what to study.
25:34 Seriously,
25:35 I get this all the time. So,
25:37 right. And so, like how how for example
25:39 do we let our security engineers force
25:41 multiply themselves,
25:42 right? You know, so we talk about things
25:44 like shifting left and security work,
25:47 right? How do we get security in from
25:49 design period? But like look, I can't
25:52 have a security engineer in every design
25:54 meeting. That just doesn't scale.
25:56 Right. Right. So, how could I have a
25:59 virtual presence that does a good job,
26:02 you know, right?
26:03 Maybe not at the level of, you know, a
26:05 world-class security engineer, but good
26:07 enough to get me started.
26:09 Right. Now, that makes a ton of sense.
26:11 And I think that it it alludes to sort
26:13 of where we where we have to be, which
26:16 is, you know, the humans still provide
26:18 the we provide the drive and the and the
26:20 direction, but we also provide the
26:22 trust, right? We we
26:24 we're not going to be able to
26:26 just let these systems, you know, oh, it
26:28 you know, we it checked off in security,
26:30 you know, security agent checked off,
26:32 we're fine. Let's deploy it. We're not
26:34 going to, you know, culturally be able
26:36 to do that and it wouldn't be a good
26:37 idea if we did, right?
26:39 Yeah. Our our trust will also grow over
26:41 time, right? Like remember, you were
26:43 talking about Amazon in in 2000. Um
26:47 there was a lot of people who did not
26:49 trust putting their credit card number
26:51 on the web in the early 2000s. They
26:53 didn't.
26:54 You know, some of it because the
26:56 technology needed to evolve, but some of
26:57 it was because that trust building
27:01 exercise that comes through demonstrable
27:06 reliability, transparency,
27:08 um sort of ongoing high quality
27:12 performance. That runway just hadn't
27:14 happened yet.
27:16 and AI needs to go through that trust
27:19 building exercise. I think we're in the
27:21 midst of it right now.
27:23 Yeah. How long do you think that that
27:24 takes?
27:25 You know, I think we certainly can learn
27:29 from the past of what we've what we've
27:33 needed to do to build trust in
27:34 technology in the past and use that to
27:37 accelerate trust building. um both
27:40 through the demonstration of
27:43 trustfulness but also through the core
27:47 technological elements that we know are
27:50 core to retaining trust, right? That is,
27:53 you know, and that does come down to
27:55 things like security and privacy and
27:58 traceability and observability.
28:01 Um all of those things are things that
28:03 we've learned historically about
28:05 building technological trust. And you
28:08 know, we need to make sure that those
28:09 things are built in to what we continue
28:12 to build in the AI space. Now,
28:15 yeah, that's that's that's I think you
28:17 make some really interesting points
28:19 because, you know, people get really
28:20 freaked out about how the world's going
28:22 to change in a second, but it's a great
28:24 the credit card example is such a great
28:25 example because the truth is back in
28:27 2000, everyone was rolling their own
28:29 credit card gateway basically, right?
28:32 And a lot of them weren't encrypted and
28:34 there were a lot of problems that
28:35 happened in a lot of places and then you
28:38 know like you said so those people were
28:39 right to not trust in some ways right
28:42 that just put your credit card in and
28:43 then as you said that you know the
28:45 building of reliability and transparency
28:47 and all that stuff like with AI will get
28:50 us there but it's going to it's it's
28:51 really a human it's a it's a human thing
28:53 it's not a technology thing right it's
28:55 it
28:56 we have to get comfortable with it but
28:59 um well thank thanks so much Erin I
29:01 think
29:02 super super exciting stuff that you're
29:03 working on and really just awesome to
29:05 see your perspective and and have your
29:07 voice at the conference. Really
29:08 appreciate you joining us.
29:10 Absolutely. My absolute pleasure and I'm
29:12 really looking forward to the
29:13 conference.
29:14 Thanks so much.
29:15 Thank you. Okay, I'm going
